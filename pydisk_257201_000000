<h2 class="chapter">SAMWELL</h2>

<p class="noindent"><em><span class="dropcap">W</span>hitetree</em>, Sam thought. <em>Please, let this be Whitetree</em>. He
remembered Whitetree. Whitetree was on the maps he&rsquo;d drawn,
on their way north. If this village was Whitetree, he knew where
they were. <em>Please, it has to be</em>. He wanted that so badly that he
forgot his feet for a little bit, he forgot the ache in his calves
and his lower back and the stiff frozen fingers he could scarcely
feel. He even forgot about Lord Mormont and Craster and the wights
and the Others. <em>Whitetree</em>, Sam prayed, to any god that might be
listening.</p>

<p>All wildling villages looked much alike, though. A huge weirwood
grew in the center of this one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but a
white tree did not mean Whitetree, necessarily. Hadn&rsquo;t the
weirwood at Whitetree been bigger than this one? Maybe he was
remembering it wrong. The face carved into the bone pale trunk was
long and sad; red tears of dried sap leaked from its eyes. <em>Was that
how it looked when we came north?</em> Sam couldn&rsquo;t recall.</p>

<p>Around the tree stood a handful of one-room hovels with sod
roofs, a longhall built of logs and grown over with moss, a stone
well, a sheepfold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but no sheep, nor any
people. The wildlings had gone to join Mance Rayder in the
Frostfangs, taking all they owned except their houses. Sam was
thankful for that. Night was coming on, and it would be good to
sleep beneath a roof for once. He was so tired. It seemed as though
he had been walking half his life. His boots were falling to
pieces, and all the blisters on his feet had burst and turned to
callus, but now he had new blisters <em>under</em> the callus, and his toes
were getting frostbitten.</p>

<p>But it was either walk or die, Sam knew. Gilly was still weak
from childbirth and carrying the babe besides; she needed the horse
more than he did. The second horse had died on them three days out
from Craster&rsquo;s Keep. It was a wonder she lasted that long,
poor half-starved thing. Sam&rsquo;s weight had probably done for
her. They might have tried riding double, but he was afraid the
same thing would happen again. <em>It&rsquo;s better that I walk</em>.</p>

<p>Sam left Gilly in the longhall to make a fire while he poked his
head into the hovels. She was better at making fires; he could
never seem to get the kindling to catch, and the last time
he&rsquo;d tried to strike a spark off flint and steel he managed
to cut himself on his knife. Gilly bound up the gash for him, but
his hand was stiff and sore, even clumsier than it had been before.
He knew he should wash the wound and change the binding, but he was
afraid to look at it. Besides, it was so cold that he hated taking
off his gloves.</p>

<p>Sam did not know what he hoped to find in the empty houses.
Maybe the wildlings had left some food behind. He had to take a
look. Jon had searched the huts at Whitetree, on their way north.
Inside one hovel Sam heard a rustling of rats from a dark corner,
but otherwise there was nothing in any of them but old straw, old
smells, and some ashes beneath the smoke hole.</p>

<p>He turned back to the weirwood and studied the carved face a
moment. <em>It is not the face we saw</em>, he admitted to himself. <em>The
tree&rsquo;s not half as big as the one at Whitetree</em>. The red eyes
wept blood, and he didn&rsquo;t remember that either. Clumsily, Sam
sank to his knees. &ldquo;Old gods, hear my prayer. The Seven were
my father&rsquo;s gods but I said my words to you when I joined the
Watch. Help us now. I fear we might be lost. We&rsquo;re hungry
too, and so cold. I don&rsquo;t know what gods I believe in now,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;please, if you&rsquo;re there, help
us. Gilly has a little son.&rdquo; That was all that he could think
to say. The dusk was deepening, the leaves of the weirwood rustling
softly, waving like a thousand blood-red hands. Whether Jon&rsquo;s
gods had heard him or not he could not say.</p>

<p>By the time he returned to the longhall, Gilly had the fire
going. She sat close to it with her furs opened, the babe at her
breast. <em>He&rsquo;s as hungry as we are</em>, Sam thought. The old women
had smuggled out food for them from Craster&rsquo;s, but they had
eaten most of it by now. Sam had been a hopeless hunter even at Horn
Hill, where game was plentiful and he had hounds and huntsmen to
help him; here in this endless empty forest, the chances of him
catching anything were remote. His efforts at fishing the lakes and
half-frozen streams had been dismal failures as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much longer, Sam?&rdquo; Gilly asked. &ldquo;Is it
far, still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so far. Not so far as it was.&rdquo; Sam shrugged out
of his pack, eased himself awkwardly to the floor, and tried to
cross his legs. His back ached so abominably from the walking that
he would have liked to lean up against one of the carved wooden
pillars that supported the roof, but the fire was in the center of
the hall beneath the smoke hole and he craved warmth even more than
comfort. &ldquo;Another few days should see us there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam had his maps, but if this wasn&rsquo;t Whitetree then they
weren&rsquo;t going to be much use. <em>We went too far east to get
around that lake</em>, he fretted, <em>or maybe too far west when I tried to
double back</em>. He was coming to hate lakes and rivers. Up here there
was never a ferry or bridge, which meant walking all the way around
the lakes and searching for places to ford the rivers. It was
easier to follow a game trail than to struggle through the brush,
easier to circle a ridge instead of climbing it. <em>If Bannen or Dywen
were with us we&rsquo;d be at Castle Black by now, warming our feet
in the common room</em>. Bannen was dead, though, and Dywen gone with
Grenn and Dolorous Edd and the others.</p>

<p><em>The Wall is three hundred miles long and seven hundred feet
high</em>, Sam reminded himself. If they kept going south, they <em>had</em> to
find it, sooner or later. And he was certain that they had been
going south. By day he took directions from the sun, and on clear
nights they could follow the Ice Dragon&rsquo;s tail, though they
hadn&rsquo;t traveled much by night since the second horse had
died. Even when the moon was full it was too dark beneath the
trees, and it would have been so easy for Sam or the last garron to
break a leg. <em>We have to be well south by now, we have to be</em>.</p>

<p>What he wasn&rsquo;t so certain of was how far east or west they
might have strayed. They would reach the Wall,
yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in a day or a fortnight, it
couldn&rsquo;t be farther than that, surely,
surely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but <em>where?</em> It was the gate at
Castle Black they needed to find; the only way through the Wall for
a hundred leagues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Wall as big as Craster used to say?&rdquo; Gilly
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bigger.&rdquo; Sam tried to sound cheerful. &ldquo;So big
you can&rsquo;t even see the castles hidden behind it. But
they&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;ll see. The Wall is all ice, but the
castles are stone and wood. There are tall towers and deep vaults
and a huge longhall with a great fire burning in the hearth, day
and night. It&rsquo;s so hot in there, Gilly, you&rsquo;ll hardly
believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I stand by the fire? Me and the boy? Not for a long
time, just till we&rsquo;re good and warm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can stand by the fire as long as you like.
You&rsquo;ll have food and drink, too. Hot mulled wine and a bowl
of venison stewed with onions, and Hobb&rsquo;s bread right out of
the oven, so hot it will burn your fingers.&rdquo; Sam peeled a
glove off to wriggle his own fingers near the flames, and soon
regretted it. They had been numb with cold, but as feeling returned
they hurt so much he almost cried. &ldquo;Sometimes one of the
brothers will sing,&rdquo; he said, to take his mind off the pain.
&ldquo;Dareon sang best, but they sent him to Eastwatch.
There&rsquo;s still Halder, though. And Toad. His real name is
Todder, but he looks like a toad, so we call him that. He likes to
sing, but he has an awful voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you sing?&rdquo; Gilly rearranged her furs, and she
moved the babe from one breast to the other.</p>

<p>Sam blushed. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I know some
songs. When I was little I liked to sing. I danced too, but my lord
father never liked me to. He said if I wanted to prance around I
should do it in the yard with a sword in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you sing some southron song? For the
babe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo; Sam thought for a moment.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a song our septon used to sing to me and my
sisters, when we were little and it was time for us to go to sleep.
&lsquo;The Song of the Seven,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s called.&rdquo; He cleared
his throat and softly sang:</p>

<div class="app2"><em>The Father&rsquo;s face is stern and strong,<br></em>
<div class="app2"><em>he sits and judges right from wrong.</em><br></div>
<em>He weighs our lives, the short and long,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>and loves the little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Mother gives the gift of life,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>and watches over every wife.</em><br></div>
<em>Her gentle smile ends all strife,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>and she loves her little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Warrior stands before the foe,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>protecting us where e&rsquo;er we go.</em><br></div>
<em>With sword and shield and spear and bow,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>he guards the little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Crone is very wise and old,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>and sees our fates as they unfold.</em><br></div>
<em>She lifts her lamp of shining gold,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>to lead the little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Smith, he labors day and night,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>to put the world of men to right.</em><br></div>
<em>With hammer, plow, and fire bright,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>he builds for little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Maiden dances through the sky,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>she lives in every lover&rsquo;s sigh,</em><br></div>
<em>Her smiles teach the birds to fly,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>and give dreams to little children.</em><br></div>
<br>
<em>The Seven Gods who made us all,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>are listening if we should call.</em><br></div>
<em>So close your eyes, you shall not fall,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>they see you, little children,</em><br></div>
<em>Just close your eyes, you shall not fall,</em><br>
<div class="app2"><em>they see you, little children.</em></div></div>

<p>Sam remembered the last time he&rsquo;d sung the song with his
mother, to lull baby Dickon to sleep. His father had heard their
voices and come barging in, angry. &ldquo;I will have no more of
that,&rdquo; Lord Randyll told his wife harshly. &ldquo;You ruined
one boy with those soft septon&rsquo;s songs, do you mean to do the
same to this babe?&rdquo; Then he looked at Sam and said, &ldquo;Go
sing to your sisters, if you must sing. I don&rsquo;t want you near
my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gilly&rsquo;s babe had gone to sleep. He was such a tiny thing,
and so quiet that Sam feared for him. He didn&rsquo;t even have a
name. He had asked Gilly about that, but she said it was bad luck
to name a child before he was two. So many of them died.</p>

<p>She tucked her nipple back inside her furs. &ldquo;That was
pretty, Sam. You sing good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should hear Dareon. His voice is sweet as
mead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We drank the sweetest mead the day Craster made me a
wife. It was summer then, and not so cold.&rdquo; Gilly gave him a
puzzled look. &ldquo;Did you only sing of six gods? Craster always
told us you southrons had seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but no one sings of the
Stranger.&rdquo; The Stranger&rsquo;s face was the face of death.
Even talking of him made Sam uncomfortable. &ldquo;We should eat
something. A bite or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing was left but a few black sausages, as hard as wood. Sam
sawed off a few thin slices for each of them. The effort made his
wrist ache, but he was hungry enough to persist. If you chewed the
slices long enough they softened up, and tasted good.
Craster&rsquo;s wives seasoned them with garlic.</p>

<p>After they had finished, Sam begged her pardon and went out to
relieve himself and look after the horse. A biting wind was blowing
from the north, and the leaves in the trees rattled at him as he
passed. He had to break the thin scum of ice on top of the stream
so the horse could get a drink. <em>I had better bring her inside</em>. He
did not want to wake up at break of day to find that their horse
had frozen to death during the night. <em>Gilly would keep going even
if that happened</em>. The girl was very brave, not like him. He wished
he knew what he was going to do with her back at Castle Black. She
kept saying how she&rsquo;d be his wife if he wanted, but black
brothers didn&rsquo;t keep wives; besides, he was a Tarly of Horn
Hill, he could never wed a wildling. <em>I&rsquo;ll have to think of
something. So long as we reach the Wall alive, the rest
doesn&rsquo;t matter, it doesn&rsquo;t matter one little bit</em>.</p>

<p>Leading the horse to the longhall was simple enough. Getting her
through the door was not, but Sam persisted. Gilly was already
dozing by the time he got the garron inside. He hobbled the horse
in a corner, fed some fresh wood to the fire, took off his heavy
cloak, and wriggled down under the furs beside the wildling woman.
His cloak was big enough to cover all three of them and keep in the
warmth of their bodies.</p>

<p>Gilly smelled of milk and garlic and musty old fur, but he was
used to that by now. They were good smells, so far as Sam was
concerned. He liked sleeping next to her. It made him remember
times long past, when he had shared a huge bed at Horn Hill with two
of his sisters. That had ended when Lord Randyll decided it was
making him soft as a girl. <em>Sleeping alone in my own cold cell never
made me any harder or braver, though</em>. He wondered what his father
would say if he could see him now. <em>I killed one of the Others, my
lord</em>, he imagined saying. <em>I stabbed him with an obsidian dagger,
and my Sworn Brothers call me Sam the Slayer now</em>. But even in his
fancies, Lord Randyll only scowled, disbelieving.</p>

<p>His dreams were strange that night. He was back at Horn Hill, at
the castle, but his father was not there. It was Sam&rsquo;s castle
now. Jon Snow was with him. Lord Mormont too, the Old Bear, and
Grenn and Dolorous Edd and Pyp and Toad and all his other brothers
from the Watch, but they wore bright colors instead of black. Sam
sat at the high table and feasted them all, cutting thick slices
off a roast with his father&rsquo;s greatsword Heartsbane. There
were sweet cakes to eat and honeyed wine to drink, there was
singing and dancing, and everyone was warm. When the feast was done
he went up to sleep; not to the lord&rsquo;s bedchamber where his
mother and father lived but to the room he had once shared with his
sisters. Only instead of his sisters it was Gilly waiting in the
huge soft bed, wearing nothing but a big shaggy fur, milk leaking
from her breasts.</p>

<p>He woke suddenly, in cold and dread.</p>

<p>The fire had burned down to smouldering red embers. The air
itself seemed frozen, it was so cold. In the corner the garron was
whinnying and kicking the logs with her hind legs. Gilly sat beside
the fire, hugging her babe. Sam sat up groggy, his breath puffing
pale from his open mouth. The longball was dark with shadows, black
and blacker. The hair on his arms was standing up.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s nothing</em>, he told himself. <em>I&rsquo;m cold,
that&rsquo;s all</em>.</p>

<p>Then, by the door, one of the shadows moved. A big one.</p>

<p><em>This is still a dream</em>, Sam prayed. <em>Oh, make it that I&rsquo;m
still asleep, make it a nightmare. He&rsquo;s dead, he&rsquo;s
dead, I saw him die</em>. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come for the babe,&rdquo;
Gilly wept. &ldquo;He smells him. A babe fresh-born stinks o&rsquo;
life. He&rsquo;s come for the life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The huge dark shape stooped under the lintel, into the hall, and
shambled toward them. In the dim light of the fire, the shadow
became Small Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; Sam croaked. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s hands were coal, his face was milk, his eyes shone
a bitter blue. Hoarfrost whitened his beard, and on one shoulder
hunched a raven, pecking at his cheek, eating the dead white flesh.
Sam&rsquo;s bladder let go, and he felt the warmth running down his
legs. &ldquo;Gilly, calm the horse and lead her out. You do
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; she started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the knife. The dragonglass dagger.&rdquo; He
fumbled it out as he got to his feet. He&rsquo;d given the first
knife to Grenn, but thankfully he&rsquo;d remembered to take Lord
Mormont&rsquo;s dagger before fleeing Craster&rsquo;s Keep. He
clutched it tight, moving away from the fire, away from Gilly and
the babe. &ldquo;Paul?&rdquo; He meant to sound brave, but it came
out in a squeak. &ldquo;Small Paul. Do you know me? I&rsquo;m Sam,
fat Sam, Sam the Scared, you saved me in the woods. You carried me
when I couldn&rsquo;t walk another step. No one else could have
done that, but you did.&rdquo; Sam backed away, knife in hand,
sniveling. <em>I am such a coward</em>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt us, Paul.
Please. Why would you want to hurt us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gilly scrabbled backward across the hard dirt floor. The wight
turned his head to look at her, but Sam shouted &ldquo;<em>NO!</em>&rdquo;
and he turned back. The raven on his shoulder ripped a strip of
flesh from his pale ruined cheek. Sam held the dagger before him,
breathing like a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows. Across the longhall,
Gilly reached the garron. <em>Gods give me courage</em>, Sam prayed. <em>For
once, give me a little courage. Just long enough for her to get
away</em>.</p>

<p>Small Paul moved toward him. Sam backed off until he came up
against a rough log wall. He clutched the dagger with both hands to
hold it steady. The wight did not seem to fear the dragonglass.
Perhaps he did not know what it was. He moved slowly, but Small
Paul had never been quick even when he&rsquo;d been alive. Behind
him, Gilly murmured to calm the garron and tried to urge it toward
the door. But the horse must have caught a whiff of the
wight&rsquo;s queer cold scent. Suddenly she balked, rearing, her
hooves lashing at the frosty air. Paul swung toward the sound, and
seemed to lose all interest in Sam.</p>

<p>There was no time to think or pray or be afraid. Samwell Tarly
threw himself forward and plunged the dagger down into Small
Paul&rsquo;s back. Half-turned, the wight never saw him coming. The
raven gave a shriek and took to the air. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
dead!&rdquo; Sam screamed as he stabbed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead,
you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; He stabbed and screamed, again and again,
tearing huge rents in Paul&rsquo;s heavy black cloak. Shards of
dragonglass flew everywhere as the blade shattered on the iron mail
beneath the wool.</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s wail made a white mist in the black air. He dropped
the useless hilt and took a hasty step backwards as Small Paul
twisted around. Before he could get out his other knife, the steel
knife that every brother carried, the wight&rsquo;s black hands
locked beneath his chins. Paul&rsquo;s fingers were so cold they
seemed to burn. They burrowed deep into the soft flesh of
Sam&rsquo;s throat. <em>Run, Gilly, run</em>, he wanted to scream, but when
he opened his mouth only a choking sound emerged.</p>

<p>His fumbling fingers finally found the dagger, but when he
slammed it up into the wight&rsquo;s belly the point skidded off
the iron links, and the blade went spinning from Sam&rsquo;s hand.
Small Paul&rsquo;s fingers tightened inexorably, and began to
twist. <em>He&rsquo;s going to rip my head off</em>, Sam thought in despair.
His throat felt frozen, his lungs on fire. He punched and pulled at
the wight&rsquo;s wrists, to no avail. He kicked Paul between the
legs, uselessly. The world shrank to two blue stars, a terrible
crushing pain, and a cold so fierce that his tears froze over his
eyes. Sam squirmed and pulled,
desperate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and then he lurched
forward.</p>

<p>Small Paul was big and powerful, but Sam still outweighed him,
and the wights were clumsy, he had seen that on the Fist. The
sudden shift sent Paul staggering back a step, and the living man
and the dead one went crashing down together. The impact knocked
one hand from Sam&rsquo;s throat, and he was able to suck in a
quick breath of air before the icy black fingers returned. The
taste of blood filled his mouth. He twisted his neck around,
looking for his knife, and saw a dull orange glow. <em>The fire!</em> Only
ember and ashes remained, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he
could not breathe, or think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sam wrenched
himself sideways, pulling Paul with
him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;his arms flailed against the dirt
floor, groping, reaching, scattering the ashes, until at last they
found something hot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a chunk of charred
wood, smouldering red and orange within the
black&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;his fingers closed around it, and
he smashed it into Paul&rsquo;s mouth, so hard he felt teeth
shatter.</p>

<p>Yet even so the wight&rsquo;s grip did not loosen. Sam&rsquo;s
last thoughts were for the mother who had loved him and the father
he had failed. The longhall was spinning around him when he saw the
wisp of smoke rising from between Paul&rsquo;s broken teeth. Then
the dead man&rsquo;s face burst into flame, and the hands were
gone.</p>

<p>Sam sucked in air, and rolled feebly away. The wight was
burning, hoarfrost dripping from his beard as the flesh beneath
blackened. Sam heard the raven shriek, but Paul himself made no
sound. When his mouth opened, only flames came out. And his
eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>It&rsquo;s gone, the blue glow is
gone</em>.</p>

<p>He crept to the door. The air was so cold that it hurt to
breathe, but such a fine sweet hurt. He ducked from the longhall.
&ldquo;Gilly?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Gilly, I killed it. Gil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood with her back against the weirwood, the
boy in her arms. The wights were all around her. There were a dozen
of them, a score, more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;some had been
wildlings once, and still wore skins and
hides&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but more had been his brothers. Sam
saw Lark the Sisterman, Softfoot, Ryles. The wen on Chett&rsquo;s neck was black, his boils
covered with a thin film of ice. And that one looked like Hake,
though it was hard to know for certain with half his head missing.
They had torn the poor garron apart, and were pulling out her
entrails with dripping red hands. Pale steam rose from her
belly.</p>

<p>Sam made a whimpery sound. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
fair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Fair</em>.&rdquo; The raven landed on his shoulder.
&ldquo;<em>Fair, far, fear</em>.&rdquo; It flapped its wings, and screamed
along with Gilly. The wights were almost on her. He heard the dark
red leaves of the weirwood rustling, whispering to one another in a
tongue he did not know. The starlight itself seemed to stir, and
all around them the trees groaned and creaked. Sam Tarly turned the
color of curdled milk, and his eyes went wide as plates. <em>Ravens!</em>
They were in the weirwood, hundreds of them, thousands, perched on
the bone-white branches, peering between the leaves. He saw their
beaks open as they screamed, saw them spread their black wings.
Shrieking, flapping, they descended on the wights in angry clouds.
They swarmed round Chett&rsquo;s face and pecked at his blue eyes,
they covered the Sisterman like flies, they plucked gobbets from
inside Hake&rsquo;s shattered head. There were so many that when
Sam looked up, he could not see the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Go</em>,&rdquo; said the bird on his shoulder. &ldquo;<em>Go, go,
go</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam ran, puffs of frost exploding from his mouth. All around him
the wights flailed at the black wings and sharp beaks that assailed
them, falling in an eerie silence with never a grunt nor cry. But
the ravens ignored Sam. He took Gilly by the hand and pulled her
away from the weirwood. &ldquo;We have to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; Gilly hurried after him, holding her
baby. &ldquo;They killed our horse, how will
we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Brother!</em>&rdquo; The shout cut through the night, through
the shrieks of a thousand ravens. Beneath the trees, a man muffled
head to heels in mottled blacks and greys sat astride an elk.
&ldquo;<em>Here</em>,&rdquo; the rider called. A hood shadowed his face.</p>

<p><em>He&rsquo;s wearing blacks</em>. Sam urged Gilly toward him. The elk
was huge, a great elk, ten feet tall at the shoulder, with a rack
of antlers near as wide. The creature sank to his knees to let them
mount. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the rider said, reaching down with a
gloved hand to pull Gilly up behind him. Then it was Sam&rsquo;s
