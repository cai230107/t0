<a id="p3508" name="p3508"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3508)">The gates at Lungan were the narrow spot, Shoka had figured all the way. In the long peace, towns had spilled past their gates if they had them at all; but Lungan with its bridge was the gateway to Pan'tei and to Cheng'di, the very heart of the Empire, and the old Emperor, acting as chief of engineers in his father's time, had ordered the gates refurbished and thickened, the walls heightened, built the walled market that was also the bridge garrison at need, built the gatehouse on the Anogi road in case it ever needed to be manned.</p>
<a id="p3509" name="p3509"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3509)">It was now. Absolutely.</p>
<a id="p3510" name="p3510"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3510)">They adjusted their pace and picked their company going in the narrow gate&#151;a pig-seller with two animals done up in slings and a returning slops cart all in the same general area, and Shoka reined around the slops cart, hoping to clear the questions of the gate-guards.</p>
<a id="p3511" name="p3511"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3511)">But a guard shoved a spear in his horse's path and shied him up. "Where?" the man asked. Fittha, taking them for Oghin, likely, and willing to give them grief.</p>
<a id="p3512" name="p3512"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3512)">Shoka had the courier chit. He stopped his little column in the gateway, creating a deliberate roadblock, with a flock of goats not far behind them. "Captain's business, coming up from Anogi."</p>
<a id="p3513" name="p3513"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3513)">The man examined the chit. Damned if he could read it, Shoka thought. He took it over to his officer, as bleating goats began to leak around the nervous horses. The officer came back, and the company, on previous orders, backed and shifted in what could be restlessness on the horses' part, but contrived to block the gate. Goats bleated, dogs barked, and the slops cart was probably in it somewhere.</p>
<a id="p3514" name="p3514"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3514)">"Clear the gate!" the officer yelled. And a stream of something foreign.</p>
<a id="p3515" name="p3515"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3515)">"Aghi!" Shoka yelled back and pointed at the chit, maintaining his company right where it was.</p>
<a id="p3516" name="p3516"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3516)">"Pig!" the Fittha yelled at him. "Report to the camp, second on your left, straight on, move your ass, pig!"</p>
<a id="p3517" name="p3517"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3517)">And shoved the chit at him.</p>
<a id="p3518" name="p3518"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3518)">Shoka took it and sent his horse off fast. His company followed. <i>Stay to the background</i>, he had warned Taizu. <i>You're too much question as it is.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3519" name="p3519"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3519)">But she came up beside him as they clattered along the street and around the second corner, by a tea-shop with shattered screens and a crowd of customers that got hastily back to the walls and out of their way.</p>
<a id="p3520" name="p3520"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3520)">Used to dodging soldiers, apparently. A squad was coming from the other direction, and they went single-file for a moment.</p>
<a id="p3521" name="p3521"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3521)">Get in, he had listed the points for Taizu and all the others, find out whether soldiers come and go on the street, see if there's a way to sink into the city without reporting through Ghita's command or getting shut into that camp.</p>
<a id="p3522" name="p3522"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3522)">So when they got further down the street that led to the bridge and found soldiers no uncommon sight anywhere along the way, Shoka slowed the pace and finally took them around a corner, on a row of cheap restaurants. The air stank of cheap beer, overloaded sewers and the wind off the stockyards.</p>
<a id="p3523" name="p3523"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3523)">"Good as anywhere," Shoka said, and stopped and got down. Taizu dropped to her feet beside him, a spatter of something noxious, as the rest dismounted and gathered around. "Food and drink, someplace for the horses&#151;" He looked up at the advertisement of lodgings and looked further up at a rickety stairs.</p>
<a id="p3524" name="p3524"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3524)">Not the most prosperous place in town. Officers would lodge in finer places. Common soldiers would set up in tents, off in the camp they were supposed to go to. But mercenaries being mercenaries, they came and they went, and officers counted on payday to get them on the rolls where they could be accounted for and assigned: that had been the system ten years ago, not the official procedure, but the actual one.</p>
<a id="p3525" name="p3525"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3525)">And tent space being limited, if some mercenary squads put up in hostels, that had been winked at, so long as the town magistrate sent no complaints to the higher-ups.</p>
<a id="p3526" name="p3526"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3526)">He hoped, as he led the way into the dingy restaurant, that that was the way Ghita's officers ran the army.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3527" name="p3527"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3527)">Trail-cooking was better than the garlicky, oily mess the <i>Peony</i> dished up. They picked at it, picked out the edible bits, ate the rice, drank the cheap wine and took a collective breath.</p>
<a id="p3528" name="p3528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3528)">Three rooms, stables, meals for the lot of them. "The innkeeper's going to be damn happy," Shoka said. "He was scared when I asked for rooms. I said we were real quiet, I didn't let my company get drunk, and I pointed out with all the soldiers in town he might be glad to have us laying claim to the room down here, we were a real asset&#151;keep the place safe and all."</p>
<a id="p3529" name="p3529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3529)">"What about the camp?" Taizu said.</p>
<a id="p3530" name="p3530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3530)">"We'll take a walk about. I had a talk with the innkeeper&#151;got a little sense where things are&#151;being new in town. Ghita's here, all right, quartered in one of the big houses. The camp's where the line-troops stay, but there's a lot of billets about town, those that can afford it, mostly cavalrymen, a lot of damage&#151;damn loose discipline. I asked him if he ever got soldiers in here, he said not usually, it used to be a lot of workers from the slaughterhouses and the tannery down the street, they were used to the smell and a lot of the other teahouses didn't like the air about them&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3531" name="p3531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3531)">The men had never understood his levity, all this ride long. This time they seemed to, slight, shy humor, down-glancing.</p>
<a id="p3532" name="p3532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3532)">Only Taizu&#151;by the line between her brows&#151;was not smiling. She ate, pulling the bandages with the fingers of one hand to get food into her mouth, drinking and soaking the filthy cloth while she did.</p>
<a id="p3533" name="p3533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3533)">Impatient. Worried. Eyes darting to every movement in the room. He reached out and nudged her leg. "Easy."</p>
<a id="p3534" name="p3534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3534)">She drew an audible breath. "Time," she said in that guttural mutter that was her public voice.</p>
<a id="p3535" name="p3535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3535)">"We're doing fine."</p>
<a id="p3536" name="p3536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3536)">A dart of worried eyes. He imagined the rest of the expression, the thrust of the lip. <i>You're lying, master Shoka.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3537" name="p3537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3537)">He put a leg over the back side of the bench. "Come on, boy. Let's take a walk. &#151;You fellows stay close here. Finish your lunch. Get some sleep."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3538" name="p3538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3538)">"Where are we going?" Taizu asked as they walked the twisting stone street, past tea-shops and pepper-vendors and shops with hanging poultry and strings of garlic. People jostled past. War was in the offing, but business went on. Wives were stocking larders. Men were carrying past sacks of rice. The prices whitewashed on the boards outside shops were predictably outrageous.</p>
<a id="p3539" name="p3539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3539)">"The camp&#151;take a&#151;" He saw her eyes dart to a passing cart. "For gods' sake, what's the matter with you? Stop jumping at everything!"</p>
<a id="p3540" name="p3540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3540)">"I'm not jumping!"</p>
<a id="p3541" name="p3541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3541)">"You're nervous as a&#151;" <i>Virgin in a whorehouse</i>, the expression ran. "Calm down,dammit."</p>
<a id="p3542" name="p3542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3542)">Another dart of the eyes, a man with a load of lumber. "I'm sorry."</p>
<a id="p3543" name="p3543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3543)">"Just take it easy. You want questions? I don't."</p>
<a id="p3544" name="p3544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3544)">"There's too damn many people!"</p>
<a id="p3545" name="p3545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3545)">He looked her way, grabbed her by the shoulder and hurried her across the street, dodging the yellow streams that ran between the pavings. "That's what makes a city. Doesn't it?" The panic was infectious. It was a weakness in her he had never reckoned on. Damn, she had never been in a town larger than Ygotai; they had touched no more than the edge of Anogi, ahorse and bound out of it as fast as they dared. On the road she had watched the people with that kind of attention, eyes checking every movement. Crazy-dangerous, people would think.</p>
<a id="p3546" name="p3546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3546)">It was everything he had taught her in the forest, tracking every move and every sound that came strange to her, but everything was strange here and there was too much of it, too fast, all at once.</p>
<a id="p3547" name="p3547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3547)">"Shut your ears," he said. "Be blind. Trust my eyes. You're watching too much, too hard. Just wait for my cues, all right? Like in practice. Don't react."</p>
<a id="p3548" name="p3548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3548)">"Yes," she'said quietly. Her stride changed, became easier.</p>
<a id="p3549" name="p3549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3549)">"Just a lot of people. Civilized people. They don't jump at you. Not in broad daylight. Just a lot of racket on these damn cobbles, covers a lot of sound. Echoes off the walls, plays hell with your sense of where things are. New place, new senses. You'll get used to it."</p>
<a id="p3550" name="p3550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3550)">You'd <i>better</i>, he thought. <i>Damn fast.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3551" name="p3551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3551)">Take her back to the tea-house, leave her with Chun and the rest&#151;</p>
<a id="p3552" name="p3552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3552)"><i>She can't handle this. She's going to make a mistake. First man who startles her, she II jump&#151;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3553" name="p3553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3553)"><i>Berserker. That's what she gives off.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3554" name="p3554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3554)">Taizu in the dark, naked shape among the bandits, blade flashing&#151;</p>
<a id="p3555" name="p3555"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3555)"><i>Everyone's her enemy but me. All the way from Hua&#151;hiding and running&#151;and two years learning to hear a leaf drop&#151;learning my footstep in the dark, on the dirt, on the porch&#151;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3556" name="p3556"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3556)"><i>Anyone else&#151;anyone she can't identify&#151;dead. She's that fast. And react is all I've taught her.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3557" name="p3557"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3557)"><i>This is a mistake, her being here is a mistake, we ought to turn around now and go back&#151;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3558" name="p3558"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3558)">Horsemen were coming down the street at their backs. She did not turn and look. She was settling, he thought. Of course she was settling, she had never failed, not in any move he had taught her.</p>
<a id="p3559" name="p3559"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3559)">Walk her around, let her see the bridge, get the feel of the town, ask a few questions, go back to the teahouse for a drink and have a talk with her in the room. That was the sensible thing to do.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3560" name="p3560"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3560)">The air smelled of the river before they got as far as the market, and the masts of river-craft, sparse as they were, stood against the pale gray of the water.</p>
<a id="p3561" name="p3561"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3561)">A girl from Hua had to stop and stare when she saw it. A boy from Yiungei had done the same thing, contemplating riding that great span on horseback.</p>
<a id="p3562" name="p3562"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3562)">Later the youth, learning the marvels of its building, how many workers had died, swept away in the current, how many attempts had failed, how often the footings had given way and wrecked the effort, and how the Imperial Engineers under the then-prince's direction had spanned the treacherous currents first with a pontoon bridge and then with stone carried by barge, to the one favor nature gave them, the subsurface island in the center, and across again, building the stone sections and filling them with rubble&#151;until the great Hisei flowed docilely through stone arches, whole boats able to pass beneath.</p>
<a id="p3563" name="p3563"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3563)">"The old Emperor wanted to bridge all the rivers," Shoka said, "but in these times&#151;gods know if it's wise."</p>
<a id="p3564" name="p3564"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3564)">"Two carts can pass on that thing!"</p>
<a id="p3565" name="p3565"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3565)">"That they can. With room between."</p>
<a id="p3566" name="p3566"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3566)">"What are we going to do?" There was an edge of panic in her voice.</p>
<a id="p3567" name="p3567"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3567)">"Don't worry about the bridge right now. It's not the important thing. It can't be, yet. Just stay calm." He walked her on, where the bridge street gave out on the old market, familiar enough ground ahead for a farmer-girl, he thought. The camp was on their left, towering walls of buff stone that closed off the esplanade as far as the river-edge. Not yet for that, he thought, looking down the aisles of tents, dislodged from those grounds, rilled the paved esplanade where jugglers and trinket-sellers and artists had made carnivals in peacetime, amid a host of sit-down drink-sellers and pastry-makers. Not nowadays. The whole bazaar had been displaced. Best just wander around a little, get the temperature of the place.</p>
<a id="p3568" name="p3568"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3568)">If there was anyone desperately worried these days, it was surely the merchants with bored, off-duty foreign mercenaries walking among their displays. He and Taizu got looks&#151;rough-looking, the dust washed off while they had been up surveying the rooms, but even a washing-down had failed to get the cracks between the plates and weavings of the armor; and the armor-robes had gone to a kind of dim patina of dirt and grease.</p>
<a id="p3569" name="p3569"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3569)">&#151;"Better we clean up a little," he had said to the company. "Get a little trail dust off."</p>
<a id="p3570" name="p3570"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3570)">Which the company had known how to understand. Only Taizu's bandages had escaped washing&#151;and Taizu with her filthy sheepskin coat, her topknot and her bandages was easily the worst, the latter by now stained with food, trail dirt, an appalling amount of old blood and a small circle of new&#151;Eidi had contributed that this morning as they were setting out, to make the wound seem recent, for fear someone might question it otherwise.</p>
<a id="p3571" name="p3571"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3571)">But the looks it drew here gave him second thoughts &#151;a ghastly wound, a soldier from off a fighting front. People shied from it and stared for more than fear of pilferage, and doubtless whispered after they had passed.</p>
<a id="p3572" name="p3572"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3572)">War-jitters here too, the same as on tannery row. And a <i>lot</i> of soldiers on guard by the bridge.</p>
<a id="p3573" name="p3573"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3573)"><i>What are we going to do?</i> he imagined Taizu's question. She felt steadier, as if her focus had come back. There was noise and confusion on all sides as they walked the quayside. Someone chopped a chicken close by them and Taizu glanced that way&#151;but any soldier might. At the next aisle a whore importuned them. Taizu stared.</p>
<a id="p3574" name="p3574"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3574)">"No," Shoka snarled, and the whore yelled out something about boy-lovers as he pulled Taizu past.</p>
<a id="p3575" name="p3575"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3575)">A sweetmeat at a booth in mid-market, a cup of wine in an area that smelled less of the fish and poultry-sellers. Taizu sipped through her bandages, returned the cup to the vendor.</p>
<a id="p3576" name="p3576"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3576)">Horsemen came through, <i>not</i> mercenaries. Banner of Angen, red circle on black.</p>
<a id="p3577" name="p3577"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3577)">Gitu.</p>
<a id="p3578" name="p3578"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3578)">Taizu went completely still. Not a twitch. Then she moved again naturally, put the cup up.</p>
<a id="p3579" name="p3579"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3579)">"Through?" A male hand reached for it, four, five soldiers moving up to the drink-vendor. Shoka drew in his breath, heart speeding, but Taizu nodded calmly, and before he could get her out:</p>
<a id="p3580" name="p3580"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3580)">"Where you in from?" one asked.</p>
<a id="p3581" name="p3581"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3581)">"South," Shoka said, edging in, trying to catch Taizu's expression past the bandages, with the panic feeling that she might just, if he got tied down in the first chance they had had to find out vital information&#151;walk off down the row and vanish in the crowd. He put his hand on her shoulder, and felt the tension. "Up from Taiyi."</p>
<a id="p3582" name="p3582"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3582)">The mercenaries were all attention. "Bad down there?"</p>
<a id="p3583" name="p3583"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3583)">"Damn bloody awful." With a shrug. "Lost half the company."</p>
<a id="p3584" name="p3584"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3584)">"Buy you a drink," the one said, and threw out half the contents of his cup, put it back, and indicated the edge of the market square, the sit-down wine-shops. Meaning he and his wanted the rumors.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3585" name="p3585"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3585)">"Lost all our money," he said over a cup of hot wine, too worried to feel the alcohol he had at lunch and after, thank the gods he had <i>had</i> the lunch. It was Taizu he was worried about; but if worry burned it out of him, Taizu had enough going in her, he reckoned, to burn off twice her capacity, and she was steady as he could ask&#151;not a tremor in the hand that carried the cup, no gulping down the wine, just measured sips.</p>
<a id="p3586" name="p3586"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3586)">"I've been twenty years hereabouts," Shoka said. "Not this recent stuff. I hired on to a lord, personal. I was just a kid, Juni's age, here. Traveled with a caravan, got to Ygotai, I thought I'd seen a city." Not too much confidence too fast. He spilled the bits and pieces he had cobbled together, reason for a mercenary to speak the language and forget his own. "Hell, Lungan in those days&#151;I came up looking for hire, I mean, in those days, there weren't that many places you could get, but I got a post with this old gentleman&#151;just watch his horses. And pretty soon I was in the house guard. Ten years with that old gentleman. Then this. Captain killed, no damn pay&#151;So I get up here, hell, I report what I know. Do I get any damn pay for risking my ass? I should've cut out down to Mandi, get the hell <i>out</i>, before this whole damn thing comes down&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3587" name="p3587"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3587)">"What's the story down there?"</p>
<a id="p3588" name="p3588"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3588)">Shoka took a breath, shook his head. "I know too much."</p>
<a id="p3589" name="p3589"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3589)">"Like what?"</p>
<a id="p3590" name="p3590"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3590)">"I can't. Can't talk." He put a leg over the bench, gathered up his sword. "Come on, Juni. We'd better get back."</p>
<a id="p3591" name="p3591"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3591)">"You're drinking our money, you sit down. What've you heard?"</p>
<a id="p3592" name="p3592"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3592)">"It's not heard, man, it's <i>seen</i>." He settled back again, leaned confidentially across the table. "That's what they don't want spread. . . . And not a damn <i>copper</i> for it!"</p>
<a id="p3593" name="p3593"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3593)">Heads leaned forward. Shoka looked around him.</p>
<a id="p3594" name="p3594"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3594)">"The whole south's coming up here. Every damn province has come in with the rebels, and they're <i>moving</i>, they've gathered up more men than you'd think was <i>in</i> the south&#151;I've seen them. I've seen things&#151;" He dropped his voice and looked around, as a waiter passed. "We're sitting in the middle of this damn city&#151;you know who this Saukendar <i>is?</i>"</p>
<a id="p3595" name="p3595"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3595)">"Warleader. On the outs with the Regent."</p>
<a id="p3596" name="p3596"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3596)">"He was damn popular. These aren't happy people. I'm telling you, twenty years in this country, and I know something, I know something scares hell out of me, sitting here in this town. This whole damn country's boiling up around us&#151;that's what I'm feeling, all these damn streets and every window just watching&#151;I was in the riots back in P'eng. ..."</p>
<a id="p3597" name="p3597"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3597)">They shifted on the benches.</p>

<a id="p3600" name="p3600"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3600)">"You did fine," he said, squeezing hard. "You did fine, boy."</p>

<a id="p3612" name="p3612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3612)">He was still thinking about that, along the row of booths and along by the back way, among the restaurants, decidedly the best way for two drunken soldiers to slip back into the city streets.</p>
<a id="p3613" name="p3613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3613)">Straight on down the row and around the corner, face to face with a foreign-looking man in a fur-trimmed cap. Whose eyes widened.</p>
<a id="p3614" name="p3614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3614)">"No, you don't!" Shoka grabbed the man and shoved him up against the wall, holding him by a fistful of expensive Shin brocade, thinking about murder, just a dagger in the gut and silence thereafter&#151;no matter he had drunk this man's tea and shared his fire.</p>
<a id="p3615" name="p3615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3615)">Master Yi was evidently thinking about that too. He was shaking, his teeth chattering. "I don't know you," he said, "I swear, I don't know you!"</p>
<a id="p3616" name="p3616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3616)">He was a fool not to kill the man. He knew that. A damned fool with thousands of lives riding on him. But it was an old man, a scared man, who pried weakly at his hands and looked as if he was going to die of shock.</p>
<a id="p3617" name="p3617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3617)">He jerked the trader into the shadow of a wagon, less in the way of witnesses. Master Yi was gasping for air, and it was not even a close grip he had on him.</p>
<a id="p3618" name="p3618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3618)">"Master Yi!" Taizu said, female voice, whisper gone too high.</p>
<a id="p3619" name="p3619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3619)">"I never saw you!" Master Yi protested. "I don't know a thing, I swear, I don't want to know anything&#151;"</p>

<a id="p3621" name="p3621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3621)">A shake of the head, vehement. "I swear, I don't know!"</p>
<a id="p3622" name="p3622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3622)">Someone came near, decided otherwise about going down that particular aisle.</p>

<a id="p3624" name="p3624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3624)">"Are we going to kill him?" Taizu asked.</p>
<a id="p3625" name="p3625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3625)">"No, no, no," Master Yi said. "I swear, I swear!"</p>
<a id="p3626" name="p3626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3626)">Shoka fingered the gilt braid and the fur on Master Yi's coat. Master Yi stood absolutely still.</p>
<a id="p3627" name="p3627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3627)">"You know we can't afford to have you spreading lies," Shoka said. "What's my name, Master Yi? I'm sure you followed us. I'm sure you noticed a sudden dearth of bandits. We did you a favor. Now you spread gossip about us."</p>
<a id="p3628" name="p3628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3628)">"I gave you hospitality!"</p>

<a id="p3633" name="p3633"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3633)">Shoka took a good pinch of expensive fur. "You've heard the rumors. Haven't you? You've heard all the rumors. Let me tell you, foreigners aren't going to fare well here, not at all. You know what's across that bridge?"</p>
<a id="p3634" name="p3634"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3634)">A shake of the head, widened eyes.</p>
<a id="p3635" name="p3635"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3635)">"An army, Master Yi. &#151;And do you know what's <i>this</i> side of the bridge?"</p>

<a id="p3638" name="p3638"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3638)">^What, m'lord?"</p>
<a id="p3639" name="p3639"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3639)">"The <i>people</i>, Master Yi, the people. And my agents, here, there, wherever they need to be, all through the city.

<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3642" name="p3642"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3642)">Guards came and went, slow patrol, up and down in front of the walls and the gate. Curved, elegant roofs rose up in tiers, porches lit with lanterns in the dusk. Guards there too.</p>
<a id="p3643" name="p3643"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3643)">"It's big as a castle," Taizu whispered.</p>
<a id="p3644" name="p3644"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3644)">"Almost," Shoka said, measuring the wall with his eye. And feeling the ache in his leg, that came with a cold night, a lot of riding and walking during the day. For a moment, considering that obstacle and the guards, he despaired. Too high, too far, too well guarded. He pushed Taizu back and retreated into the shadow of the winding lane that offered a view of the Lieng estate, where Master Yi waited in the nook of a much poorer gateway.</p>
<a id="p3645" name="p3645"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3645)">"What are you going to do?" Yi whispered. Dragged from the market to mid-city, spying on the Regent's headquarters . . . Master Yi was not a happy man.</p>
<a id="p3646" name="p3646"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3646)">Not alone in that state, Shoka thought sourly, and calmed himself with a glance at Taizu. No panic. Just the confidence master Shoka, after all this, was going to come up with something remarkable.</p>
<a id="p3647" name="p3647"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3647)">Except master Shoka could not scale a wall any longer.</p>
<a id="p3648" name="p3648"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3648)">"What are you going to do?" master Yi reiterated, at a higher pitch.</p>
<a id="p3649" name="p3649"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3649)">"Just be calm. I know what we need. Let's go."</p>
<a id="p3650" name="p3650"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3650)">"You're going to break in there."</p>
<a id="p3651" name="p3651"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3651)">He turned and laid a very gentle hand on master Yi's sleeve. "Master Yi, you <i>know</i> what we're going to do. And you know what your choices are. I see no reason, if you're the cause of a disaster to us&#151;not to elaborate your part in this when the authorities ask questions. Do you understand me, master Yi?"</p>
<a id="p3652" name="p3652"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3652)">A speechless nod.</p>
<a id="p3653" name="p3653"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3653)">"Good. Good. I suppose you've got some friend at the market that has a pushcart he'd let you rent."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3654" name="p3654"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3654)">It was nothing unusual that rattled up in the alley back of the <i>Peony</i> and stopped, a cart with two huge well-capped jars. A man pushing, an assistant panting along beside: nothing particularly remarkable that two tired soldiers came home about the same time as the slops-wagon arrived, in the night. "That's fine," Shoka said to the older of the pair. "You're done." Bad choice of words, perhaps. He patted Yi on the shoulder and picked up the bundle the cart carried besides the jars. "I owe you."</p>
<a id="p3655" name="p3655"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3655)">"I just want to get back!" Yi said.</p>
<a id="p3656" name="p3656"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3656)">"Taizu."</p>
<a id="p3657" name="p3657"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3657)">Steel came out. Yi and his servant looked that direction, flinging up hands that in no wise would protect against a longsword.</p>
<a id="p3658" name="p3658"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3658)">"Just walk upstairs, master Yi. You'll be safe&#151;with men of mine. I just don't want a fuss right now. Understand?"</p>
<a id="p3659" name="p3659"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3659)">Chun was watching from the stairs. Chun came down, doubtfully, but when he nodded to him, Chun drew his sword and came on down to the alley. "Captain?"</p>
<a id="p3660" name="p3660"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3660)">"Just an old friend I want you to keep track of for a few hours. Give him a little wine, a little dinner. He's had quite a walk. His man here's a pleasant enough fellow. But I'd see he stayed seated. I promised the innkeep we wouldn't be brawling."</p>
<a id="p3661" name="p3661"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3661)">Upstairs. Downstairs again with a long bundle this time, two rag-wrapped slop-men, who shoved the bundle onto the cart beside the jars and set off again.</p>
<a id="p3662" name="p3662"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3662)">No rule against a couple of soldiers going about with a bow, maybe, counting that everyone was going about in full kit and rattling with swords, but in a city this anxious, in the Regent's neighborhood, it was a weapon that could get a second, calculating stare.</p>
<a id="p3663" name="p3663"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3663)">Slop-men never did. "It's something no one wants to notice," Shoka had said. "They come and they go. <i>Especially</i> to the big houses. At night, so the master never has to notice at all."</p>
<a id="p3664" name="p3664"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3664)">"No worse than pigs," Taizu had said. "I've shoveled a lot of it."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3665" name="p3665"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3665)">Rumble and rattle across cobbles, half the width of Lungan. "Damn potholes," Shoka said, as the cart bucked and jolted against his hands. Numb to the wrist as they turned up the street next that of the Lieng mansion, his leg aching. They were in full kit under the rags, Taizu without her bandages, with her face muffled up with a cap and a dirty brown scarf against an edge of river chill in the night, Shoka with a thick scarf and ragged layers of robes&#151;perfectly comfortable if one were not wearing two stone of armor under it and pushing a damn rickety cart loaded with two jars that made it impossible to see the rough spots ahead. Sweat poured on Shoka's face. "I can't say much for the Regent's streets, either."</p>
<a id="p3666" name="p3666"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3666)">"Could be mud and raining," Taizu said cheerfully&#151;who had walked free as a lark all the way, and doing a great deal better now that the streets were clear of day-traffic. They met the occasional night patrol, the occasional other service-cart, the occasional drunk; and a scattering of others with midnight business, mostly in groups.</p>
<a id="p3667" name="p3667"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3667)">But this street was conspicuously patrolled, conspicuously vacant of traffic, and lit with lanterns, a long, lonely way up to the lane they had spied out as the servants' access.</p>
<a id="p3668" name="p3668"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3668)">There were soldiers at the turn. Don't notice anyone, Shoka said. If you want to go invisible, it's a two-sided thing. Invisible people don't look at anyone when anyone's watching: that way no one looks at them.</p>
<a id="p3669" name="p3669"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3669)">So he kept his eyes on his cart, kept himself in a quiet little fog, the way he had told Taizu: There's a time to see everything. There's a time to see nothing. No one will attack us without warning. Who'd do a thing like that, to some poor slop-men? We're too humble ana too dull for soldiers to challenge, don't even be expecting it until we get to the scullery gate.</p>
<a id="p3670" name="p3670"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3670)">No challenge from the sentries at the corner. He took a look around the jars and aimed the cart down the middle of the lane, with the wheels rumbling and chattering.</p>
<a id="p3671" name="p3671"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3671)">Right up to the gate.</p>
<a id="p3672" name="p3672"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3672)">"Evenin", sir," Shoka said. Three guards, one leaving the curb to look them over.</p>
<a id="p3673" name="p3673"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3673)">"You aren't the ordinary," the guard said.</p>
<a id="p3674" name="p3674"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3674)">"Bashed his foot," Shoka said. "He asked me swing over from my regulars an' take care o' his."</p>
<a id="p3675" name="p3675"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3675)">The guard grunted and opened up the gate. "You wait. Man brings it out."</p>
<a id="p3676" name="p3676"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3676)"><i>Damn.</i> "I don't mind, sir, we can fetch it."</p>
<a id="p3677" name="p3677"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3677)">"Ain't the rule." The one guard turned his back. And went sailing into the wall. The second and third closed in, drawing swords. Shoka dodged one, whirled past and took one with a knee and an elbow, bending him over, passing him to Taizu, as he spun again and knocked the third guard flying into the cart.</p>
<a id="p3678" name="p3678"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3678)">The first man let out a yell. Shoka kicked him, grabbed his sword from the bundle off the cart and Taizu grabbed her bow and quiver.</p>
<a id="p3679" name="p3679"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3679)">Into the scullery-court, then, fast as they could scuttle, and up a stairway to a garden terrace.</p>
<a id="p3680" name="p3680"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3680)">"I'm <i>sorry</i> about that!" Taizu whispered as she crouched down beside him in the shadow of a potted pine and nocked an arrow.</p>
<a id="p3681" name="p3681"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3681)">"Damn, I've gotten soft! Stay here!"</p>
<a id="p3682" name="p3682"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3682)">He sprinted along the terrace, across the shadow-bars of the pines and the lantern-light of the porch above. The hue and cry was spreading. Shouts racketed off the walls and lost direction in the porches.</p>
<a id="p3683" name="p3683"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3683)">He knew Ghita. Nothing but the best. Center of the mansion, second or third level, in regal quiet and elegant splendor.</p>
<a id="p3684" name="p3684"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3684)">Damn mistake not to have knifed the poor sods out by the gate. It would have gained a little&#151;not much, but a little.</p>
<a id="p3685" name="p3685"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3685)">Up a wooden stairs as lanterns flared above. He ducked low, dived off the stairs into a clump of juniper as guards came thundering down the walk, headed for the scullery gate.</p>
<a id="p3686" name="p3686"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3686)">No question whether Ghita was awake by now.</p>
<a id="p3687" name="p3687"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3687)">And one good thing about the guards: they made so much thumping on the wooden porches he could run full out. He scrambled up onto the stairs, up onto that porch and right through a fragile window-screen, crash! right into the second-level hall.</p>
<a id="p3688" name="p3688"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3688)">Guards ran to stop him. They spread themselves out. That was a mistake. One-two, three, four, and five&#151;an arc of blood spattered across a fresco of mist and mountains. He ran the hall, shoved open the doors at the end.</p>
<a id="p3689" name="p3689"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3689)">More guards in a lighted hallway, a startled cluster of screaming women who had no time to scatter. He took one guard and the other, that second man down with a crippling wound, howling&#151;</p>
<a id="p3690" name="p3690"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3690)">A man in front of him. A face like a mask of terror; brocade robes, trailing hair. Not Ghita. He <i>knew</i> the man, memory said, and a heartbeat later knew the boy inside the soft, plump face.</p>
<a id="p3691" name="p3691"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3691)">The Emperor himself. Beijun.</p>
<a id="p3692" name="p3692"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3692)">"Shoka!" the Emperor breathed, under the clatter of arriving guards.</p>
<a id="p3693" name="p3693"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3693)">From the hall behind. A good score of them.</p>
<a id="p3694" name="p3694"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3694)">"Shoka, help me!"</p>
<a id="p3695" name="p3695"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3695)">He froze, sword lifted, guards behind, in a dead-end room.</p>
<a id="p3696" name="p3696"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3696)">And whirled and charged on the last instant, cut his way left and right and never looked to see what he hit, only where he was going. The leg burned as he ran, tore, gods knew what.</p>
<a id="p3697" name="p3697"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3697)">He ran, grabbed a corner, swung onto a stairway and took it with desperate abandon.</p>
<a id="p3698" name="p3698"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3698)">A matching screen. He hit it with his shoulder, rolled off the sill with his hip and somersaulted onto the wooden porch&#151;</p>
<a id="p3699" name="p3699"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3699)">No fear of burglars, had lord Lieng.</p>
<a id="p3700" name="p3700"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3700)">Right off the porch onto the junipers, thank gods for the armor. He clawed his way to the low wooden fence, swung his leg over, and pelted along the terrace with the shouts of guards in his ears and of a sudden the sharp whisper of arrows passing him.</p>
<a id="p3701" name="p3701"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3701)">She was there, she was waiting for him in the shadow of the wall, and guards were dying behind him.</p>
<a id="p3702" name="p3702"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3702)">"Shed it!" he hissed as he reached her post. He stripped the rags off, pulled a bamboo pin off an armor strap and furiously grabbed up his topknot and pinned it. She threw down her bow then, dumped the quiver, the rags and the hat, and scuttled down the stairs with him, down to the scullery court.</p>
<a id="p3703" name="p3703"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3703)">Soldiers came in the open gate. "Up there!" Shoka yelled at them, pointing with his sword. "<i>Move</i>, dammit, they're up there! &#151;You and you, get that gate!"</p>
<a id="p3704" name="p3704"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3704)">The soldiers poured past them. The designates turned to close the gate.</p>
<a id="p3705" name="p3705"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3705)">And died quietly.</p>
<a id="p3706" name="p3706"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3706)">"Damn," Shoka said, and walked over the body that blocked the doorway, out onto the sidewalk by the cart. There was one man moving faintly, of the injured. One was gone. One lay still.</p>
<a id="p3707" name="p3707"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3707)">They walked down the lane to the corner, where a sentry stood.</p>
<a id="p3708" name="p3708"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3708)">"One got out!" Shoka said hoarsely.</p>
<a id="p3709" name="p3709"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3709)">"Haven't seen a thing!" the sentry said.</p>
<a id="p3710" name="p3710"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3710)">Shoka pointed with his sword, uphill, beyond the lights. "We'll check up this way!"</p>
<a id="p3711" name="p3711"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3711)">It was just that easy to walk away, into the alley, sheathe the swords, and vanish into the maze of Lun-gan streets.</p>
<a id="p3712" name="p3712"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3712)">But he had to tell Taizu then: "I didn't get him. I couldn't get that far. &#151;I ran into the Emperor."</p>
<a id="p3713" name="p3713"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3713)">"Here!"</p>
<a id="p3714" name="p3714"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3714)">Soft, terrified face. <i>Shoka, help me!</i>&nbsp;</p>
