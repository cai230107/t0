<h2 class="chapter">25</h2>

<p>I left Smoke. Nobody was anywhere near the wagon except Mother
Gota and Thai Dei. I joined them. They said nothing. I ate without
speaking myself, drank a lot of water, climbed back into the wagon
and took a long nap. I dreamed. The dreams were not pleasant.
Soulcatcher was there and she seemed to be having a wonderful time.
Messing with us, no doubt, because that is where she found her
fun.</p>

<p>I woke up and ate again, barely aware that I was devouring some
of Mother Gota&rsquo;s worst cuisine. I swilled water as though
this was my first chance in weeks. I was vaguely aware that Thai
Dei seemed troubled whenever he looked at me. I tried to figure
that out but I could not concentrate.</p>

<p>It was late. The camp itself was quiet. The soldiers were still
forward. Night sentries prowled watchfully, warned that there were
Stranglers in the enemy camp. They gossiped softly as they paused
to warm their hands by the fires. Farther back, some survivors from
among the camp followers gathered their pitiful belongings and
stole away before they got rounded up and herded forward again.</p>

<p>Vicious fighting continued on the heights. Mogaba intended to
contest every foot of ground.</p>

<p>Not all the camp followers had been able to get away. Fires on
Lady&rsquo;s flank once again began to mask our camp with smoke.
Did the Captain have some new devilment in mind?</p>

<p>I asked him when he turned up a while later. &ldquo;I hope they
think so up there,&rdquo; he said. He could not stop grinning.
&ldquo;For the rest of his life I want Mogaba looking over his
shoulder, jumping at shadows, thinking there&rsquo;s another trap
about to open under his feet. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be one
sometime.&rdquo; He laughed again.</p>

<p>All the senior officers began gathering at a fire laid like a
Gunni festival bonfire. Politically neutral priests of all faiths
performed rites of thanksgiving. Even Lady came in, accompanied by
her officers and admirers. She looked like a demigoddess, more real
than any Taglian deity but the dreaded Kina. In the modern era only
Kina seemed interested in mundane affairs.</p>

<p>But she had a personal interest.</p>

<p>Hard to tell who among the crowd was most boggled. Blade settled
beside the Old Man. He could not stop grinning. He could not stop
babbling at his old buddy Swan. Pity Cordy Mather was back home
with the Woman. He would have gotten a kick out of this, too.</p>

<p>I had not seen Blade for years. Back then he had been a taciturn
cynic. Nothing like this. And One-Eye had not had time to get a
still running yet.</p>

<p>Blade bellowed at Croaker. Croaker bellowed right back. Swan
told me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind them two. They haven&rsquo;t
gotten over the hand-holding stage yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess there must have been a lot of strain while the
con was running.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Old Man heard Swan but ignored him. &ldquo;Tomorrow
it&rsquo;s good old-fashioned hey diddle diddle, straight up the
middle.
The last thing Mogaba will expect from me. Prince, you get first
go. Have your men show us how good they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took a long drink of water, wishing One-Eye had managed to get
something made for tonight. But that would not have gone over. None
of the Taglian religions tolerated beer, nor did Lady or the
Prince, who did not want drunken soldiers screwing things up. But
what they did not see they could not condemn. So I might just
suggest to One-Eye that he get a move on.</p>

<p>I asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually going to tell us
what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lax humor entered the Captain&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; He leaned close, whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let this get out. I don&rsquo;t want anybody easing up. But
they&rsquo;re not sending shadows out to spy.&rdquo; He pointed as
a fireball headed up the pass. We had not seen much of Lady&rsquo;s
big magic here yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saving them.&rdquo; He grinned again. This
grin took in everyone around us. He spoke to the assembly. &ldquo;I
think you all know what you&rsquo;re expected to do next. Get some
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How did everybody know what they were expected to do next? The
little he had told anyone had been extremely vague.</p>

<p>Croaker looked at Lady. She seemed at the point of collapse.
This was tiring work but her exhaustion went beyond what you would
expect.</p>

<p>Some hard guy, my Captain. Sometimes his feelings were obvious.
He hurt for the woman he loved. &ldquo;Swan. Hang around. I want to
talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was politely invited to move my unwelcome ass along and get
some rest of my own.</p>
