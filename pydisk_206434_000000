#bookz is dedicated to releasing high-quality, well-formatted electronic versions of some of our favorite books, without much fanfare.  

We are releasing in .rtf format, with a minimum of formatting information - mostly just font-size, italics and bold print.  These files should readily convert to your favorite reading format, with a minimum of fuss - but still be correctable, in case we have missed any typos.

If you find typos or errors one of our texts, please pass along a copy of any corrections you make to someone in the channel -- To find the current location of #bookz, see the page at http://bookz.griffin3.com/

We soon hope to have a canonical list of e-book (fiction) -- as complete as we can make it.  Hopefully, it will be a roughly complete list, useful to check to see if a book has been scanned already, before you start the nasty business of OCR-ing it yourself.

If you wish to contribute scanning or proof-reading time to the #bookz effort, please contact one of the ops, in #bookz.
