The three of them, the dozen of them, the hundreds of them, had struck on Klimos, burned everything to the ground.</p>

<a id="p5495" name="p5495"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5495)">A boat came out to investigate, but it was only some local fishermen: Did you see those strange faerie lights last night? And have you heard about the Warrior? He could be anywhere&#151;I hear the slavers are pissing down their legs any time they hear a loud fart.</p>
<a id="p5496" name="p5496"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5496)">They went ashore, but there was nothing but rumors.</p>
