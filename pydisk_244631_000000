  </p>
  <p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t sit still, you&#8217;re going to end up looking like a clown instead of a beauty queen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; cringed as Deena leaned over her, brandishing a wand of mascara. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a beauty queen. I just want to be me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Same diff,&#8221; Deena said.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; pretended she hadn&#8217;t heard, and hopped off the table. Deena had made her unbraid her hair first thing, and now Zo&#235; twisted a strand around her finger as she walked from the sofa to the kitchen and back again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is with you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; nibbled on her lip. &#8220;I&#8217;m nervous. I&#8217;m really, really nervous.&#8221; She glanced around the room. &#8220;We&#8217;re sure Elmer&#8217;s not here, right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The ferret?&#8221; Deena asked. &#8220;Are you going to clue me in on what&#8217;s with the ferret?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just not real keen on him reporting back to my brother with a full dissertation on the state of my nerves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Deena. &#8220;Because, of course, the ferret talks to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Zo&#235; said. &#8220;Hale&#8217;s always dumping Elmer on me when he needs a spy. It&#8217;s his passive-aggressive way of keeping me in line, and he thinks I don&#8217;t realize.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a weird family, kid. But I&#8217;m not one to talk.&#8221; She leaned back. &#8220;So. Does the ferret talk to you, too?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He talks. I don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;m not an animalinguist.&#8221;</p>
  <p>For about half a second, Deena looked a little disconcerted. Then she shrugged. &#8220;Fair enough. At least this explains that bizarro doublespeak in the other room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; grinned. Deena was nothing if not easygoing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;At any rate, I don&#8217;t see him anywhere,&#8221; Zo&#235; said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Deena. &#8220;He&#8217;s probably in your bedroom having ferret phone sex or watching <em>Animal Planet</em>.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good point,&#8221; Zo&#235; said, managing to keep a straight face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can we get back to the makeover? Taylor will be here any minute.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t see why&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to seduce a man, you might as well start out in top form.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am <em>not</em> going to sed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not that you don&#8217;t look great even without makeup.&#8221; Deena waved an eyelash curler like a small weapon. &#8220;But you&#8217;ll want to look extra hot for Mr. Midnight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>&#8220;Mr. Midnight?&#8221;</em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>A</em> twinkle appeared in Deena&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Since Taylor&#8217;s the guy you&#8217;ve been lusting after, I&#8217;m assuming you think about him, you know ... when it&#8217;s dark.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No comment,&#8221; Zo&#235; mumbled. Her friend looked smug. Of course, she had pretty much nailed the truth on the head with the nickname. For the past few days, Zo&#235;&#8217;s nights had been filled with Taylor&#8212;the imaginary version, anyway. Disconcerting, but oh so true. &#8220;Deena, I don&#8217;t really want him to know I&#8217;m attracted to him. I mean, I spent the entire time I was at his office convincing him I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want a date-date. If I wear all of that&#8221;&#8212;she waved her hand over the cosmetics-covered table&#8212;&#8220;then surely he&#8217;s gonna think I&#8217;m interested.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Like I&#8217;ve been saying, just go for it. Damn the torpedoes, full orgasm ahead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Deenie . ..&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hmmm?&#8221; she asked, twisting up tubes of lipstick and inspecting the colors.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; raised an eyebrow and tapped her foot.</p>
  <p>Deena gave her an annoyed look. &#8220;Fine. Be a nun. But don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t try to help you.&#8221; She sniffed a tube and tossed it aside. &#8220;At any rate, you should be prepared for the slim, minuscule off chance that something does develop. And a little sheer blush and extra-volume mascara never hurt anyone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You sound like a Revlon commercial.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hey, whatever works.&#8221; She patted a cushion on the sofa. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The fact was, Zo&#235; did care about how she looked. This was Taylor, after all. Even if she wasn&#8217;t going to do anything like <em>that</em> with him .. . well, she still wanted him to notice her. Wanted it a lot, actually.</p>
  <p>Feeling rather pathetic, she sat on the coffee table in front of Deena. &#8220;Okay. Make me a new woman.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Preferably one who wasn&#8217;t terrified of the prospect of getting close to the one man she desperately wanted to get close to.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk. I&#8217;m going to do your lips. Do this,&#8221; Deena said, then puckered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Should I&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>But she couldn&#8217;t get the rest out, because Deena grabbed her mouth and made her pucker until she felt like a fish.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You told me you can control your senses when you try, right?&#8221; the blond girl asked as she brushed on a thin layer of gloss.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; nodded, since she was still pretty much lip-zipped.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re doing it right now, right? I mean, I&#8217;ve got a hold of your cheeks.&#8221;</p>
  <p>True. And all Zo&#235; felt was a rather uncomfortable squooshing sensation. She nodded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, see? There&#8217;s no reason to spend your life hiding behind some invisible line. I mean, oatmeal and rice cakes ... yuck.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re pretty tasty, actually,&#8221; she managed, but Deena looked annoyed and squeezed her lips tight again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The point is, you just need to decide what you want and then go for it. Do you want to still be a virgin when you turn twenty-five, or do you want to get out there and go for it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You make it sound so tawdry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do I? I was hoping to make it sound fun.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Fun</em>. Most women would probably agree. After all, she was going on a real date with a real man. A man she hadn&#8217;t been able to get out of her mind for days.</p>
  <p>Maybe she should let loose....</p>
  <p>Deena let go of her mouth, and Zo&#235; massaged her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Careful of the gloss.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She stood up, then ran her fingers through her hair. She started to nibble on her lower lip, then stopped, remembering the makeup. This dressing-for-success thing was complicated. &#8220;What if I really can&#8217;t handle it? His touch? What if it drives me crazy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over this, Zo. It&#8217;s <em>supposed</em> to drive you crazy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maybe. But there was crazy and then there was <em>crazy</em>. And she wasn&#8217;t sure she could manage either.</p>
  <p>And that wasn&#8217;t even her biggest fear. Knowing she was acting like one of the sixth graders with a crush, but unable to help it, she flopped back down onto the sofa. &#8220;What if he doesn&#8217;t want me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Zo&#235;, please. Why wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>About a million reasons, not the least of which was that she had absolutely no idea how to act with a guy she actually liked. &#8220;I&#8217;m almost twenty-five and I&#8217;ve never even had a real date.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to have had them. All you need is desire. And kiddo, you&#8217;ve got that in spades.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Maybe.</em> But desiring and doing were two completely different things. And Zo&#235; didn&#8217;t intend to do anything about the <em>doing</em> part.</p>
  <p>She heard Elmer stir far down the hallway, then heard him making his way toward the living room.</p>
  <p>His little head appeared around the corner, and Deena waved. &#8220;Hey there, Elmer, you cute little ferret-face.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; eyed the rodent, nibbling on her lower lip. There was no doubt in her mind that Hale had left Elmer to play chaperon&#8212;to cramp what little style she had while she went out on a date with a mortal.</p>
  <p>A fresh wave of nervousness washed over her, and she fought to shake it before remembering that she had absolutely no reason to worry. After all, she wasn&#8217;t going to do anything with the luscious Mr. Taylor.</p>
  <p>Which meant there was nothing to be nervous about. Absolutely nothing at all.</p>
  <p>A little voice in the back of her mind whispered, <em>Too bad</em>. Zo&#235; sighed, wondering which was the bigger mistake&#8212;lusting after Taylor in the first place, or promising herself she wasn&#8217;t going to do a darn thing about it.</p>
  <p>
   <br />
   <br />
  </p>
  <p>Elmer was in no mood to be called cute or ferret-face, no matter how true either description was. He considered going back to the bedroom and watching another episode of <em>Hollywood Safari,</em> but Hale wanted him to keep an eye on Zo&#235;. And from what he could tell, she needed some serious watching. The blond mortal was simply not a good influence.</p>
  <p>With a grunt, Elmer climbed up the sofa and pulled himself onto the armrest. He perched there, watching the woman named Deena as she stared back at him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So he can understand me, right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Even if you speak Swahili</em>, Elmer chittered snootily.</p>
  <p>&#8220;As far as I know,&#8221; said Zo&#235;. &#8220;He always seems to understand what I&#8217;m saying. Don&#8217;t you, Elmer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Oh, no.</em> He wasn&#8217;t about to do stupid ferret tricks for a mortal. He gave Zo&#235; a stern look, then hopped onto the sofa cushion. If the girl was really going out on a date with a mortal, he&#8217;d stay and be Hale&#8217;s spy, but that was all. He&#8217;d stay because that was his mission.</p>
  <p>And also, of course, because he was stuck here. Since ferrets couldn&#8217;t operate motor vehicles, he wasn&#8217;t exactly going anywhere else. Not unless he wanted to go out on the street to scratch out a <em>Hollywood or Bust</em> sign and try to hitch a ride.</p>
  <p>He didn&#8217;t have to like this situation, but he was going to make the best of it. With a little hiss that he hoped conveyed how utterly bored he was by the whole thing, he turned in a circle three times, curled his tail under his chin, and tried to doze.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s feeling conversational,&#8221; Deena said. She leaned down to peer at him until they were almost nose-to-nose. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he likes me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Clever lady.</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;Hale&#8217;s not too crazy about me hanging out with mortals. His snobbery probably rubbed off on Elmer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Elmer was thankful that got the blonde&#8217;s attention, and she leaned up, removing her face from the proximity of his nose. &#8220;I thought you were half-mortal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; nodded. &#8220;Hale prefers the other half.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still unclear on what &#8216;the other half is. Hint, hint.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I promised you an explanation, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all ears.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Zo&#235; said, then sighed, and Elmer echoed her. Really, the girl shouldn&#8217;t go around describing the history of the council to mortals. Rules were rules, after all.</p>
  <p>Not that Zo&#235; seemed to care.</p>
  <p>He squeaked loudly, and Zo&#235; scowled. &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re saying,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But Deena already saw me fly off the tower. She deserves an explanation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Elmer wasn&#8217;t too sure <em>deserves</em> was the word that leaped to mind. More likely she <em>deserved</em> to have her memory erased with one of those mysterious devices Zephron suspected Hieronymous was working on.</p>
  <p>But Elmer was in no position to argue. And frankly he didn&#8217;t care whether this Deena person knew the council&#8217;s history or not. He just didn&#8217;t want to see Zo&#235; suffer. Hadn&#8217;t Hale told him over and over again about how mortals didn&#8217;t understand? Deena might have bought into the flying thing, but that was a far different matter from understanding the import of the council.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; pushed herself off the couch, and he hopped up, trying to talk her out of it.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Don&#8217;t do it, Zo, he chittered. She&#8217;s not gonna believe you. You&#8216;re just going to end up looking crazy.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Zo&#235; shot him a look, but then ignored him. She paced to the bookshelf before turning back to Deena. Elmer grimaced, then hid his eyes behind his paws.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How much do you know about mythology?&#8221; Zo&#235; asked.</p>
  <p>Elmer peeked and saw Deena&#8217;s look of confusion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some.&#8221; Deena shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read a bit. School. That sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All those books on the mythological gods and goddesses ...&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; tossed Deena a copy of Edith Hamilton&#8217;s <em>Mythology</em>. &#8220;My personal family history.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Oh, that&#8217;s the way to tell her. Very subtle. Wouldn&#8217;t want to freak her out or anything. Yeesh.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Deena dropped the book. &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nope. It&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m part of a race called the Protectors. My branch of the family sort of started the Greek and Roman myths, but there&#8217;re other branches as well. If there&#8217;s a set of myths out there, chances are there&#8217;s a branch of my species that began it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deena looked at Zo&#235;, then back to the book, then back to Zo&#235; again. Then she shrugged. &#8220;Goddesses should <em>not</em> dress the way you do. Next week, first thing, we are getting you some new clothes. And your hair&#8212;every day with the braid. <em>Boring</em>. I think you need something a little more&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Deena...&#8221;</p>
  <p>The girl looked up.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a goddess.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; Deena frowned. &#8220;But you said ...&#8221; She glanced at Elmer. &#8220;She said ...&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Protectors are just... different.&#8221; Zo&#235; shrugged. &#8220;And back then ... well, I guess the whole god and goddess thing sounded like a really great cover story.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, sure. Because if you&#8217;re living back thousands of years ago and can see through walls or fly off mountains or talk to animals, you&#8217;d need a good cover story.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Zo&#235;. Elmer groaned. Apparently she hadn&#8217;t noticed the tinge of sarcasm in Deena&#8217;s voice.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I guess it does make sense,&#8221; Deena agreed. Elmer rolled over to get a better look at her. He peered at her face and, sure enough, the gal seemed to be buying it. Maybe that hadn&#8217;t been sarcasm after all. Hale was never going to believe this.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; twisted on the couch, then slid her hand under her rump.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Deena asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sitting on a big lump.&#8221; She reached between the cushions and pulled out a necklace. &#8220;There it is. I thought I&#8217;d lost it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>For just a minute it dangled from her fingers, the deep green of the gemstone reflecting onto the far wall of the room.</p>
  <p>Elmer let out a little squeal, then scrambled across the sofa, trying to get a better look.</p>
  <p>Could it be? <em>Surely not</em>.</p>
  <p>But it certainly looked to be....</p>
  <p>The stone! The gemstone from Aphrodite&#8217;s girdle. He didn&#8217;t know how it had ended up in Zo&#235;&#8217;s apartment, but there it was. And hey, who was he to question a legend?</p>
  <p>
   <br />
   <br />
  </p>
  <p>Telling Deena the whole story pushed all of Zo&#235;&#8217;s problems front and center. Now she sighed, hoping she wasn&#8217;t making a huge mistake by going out with Taylor. She should have picked someone who didn&#8217;t make her insides all whooshy, someone not quite so rugged or intense. Someone whose eyes didn&#8217;t look like they could see through her as easily as she could see through his clothing.</p>
  <p>She wanted to walk on the wild side with Taylor, but she was too scared, too nervous, whatever, to invite him to come along for the ride.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Pathetic.</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually not all that bad-looking,&#8221; Deena said.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; looked up. &#8220;Taylor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You <em>do</em> have it bad. I was talking about the rock.&#8221; Deena pointed to the necklace that still dangled from Zo&#235;&#8217;s fingers. &#8220;Are you gonna wear it tonight?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She closed her fingers around it, surprised how warm the stone felt. &#8220;A green stone with a red dress? No, thanks. I&#8217;d end up feeling like a Christmas ornament.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mind if I borrow it?&#8221; Deena leaned forward, ready to take the necklace, when Elmer came running across the cushions, took a flying leap, and soared through the air&#8212;right smack into it.</p>
  <p>Ferret, chain, and ugly gemstone tumbled to the carpet.</p>
  <p>Deena and Zo&#235; looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Guess we know what kind of toys ferrets like,&#8221; Deena said. She reached down to pick the chain back up but stopped as Elmer did a frantic little ferret dance, his fur all spiky as he bounced around on the floor. After a few seconds of that, he finally sprawled out, his eyes shifting from Zo&#235; to Deena as though he were watching a tennis match.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have no idea what&#8217;s getting him so excited.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deena shrugged, then picked up the necklace. Elmer hopped back up, running in circles around the coffee-table leg. &#8220;I think you need to cut back on his caffeine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No kidding,&#8221; said Zo&#235;, wondering what the devil was wrong with him. Maybe it was the chain. Squirrels liked shiny things. Maybe ferrets did, too. She&#8217;d have to ask Hale. &#8220;Anyway, why do you want to wear it? I thought you hated the thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate it. I said it&#8217;s ugly. And it is. But in a cool sort of way. Hoop&#8217;s taking me out tonight, and it&#8217;ll go great with this green sweater I got the other day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; frowned. &#8220;Out? I thought you were coming to the Andersons&#8216;, too. I have to do this alone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, no. We&#8217;re doing both. The Andersons&#8217; first, and then Hoop&#8217;s taking me to the Hollywood Bowl.&#8221;</p>
  <p>What was wrong with <em>that</em> picture? Zo&#235; crossed her arms over her chest. &#8220;Your Hoop? Mr. I-think-<em>Vixens-In</em>-<em>Space</em>-is-great-cinema? He&#8217;s going to the Bowl?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deena nodded, looking smug. &#8220;<em>Bugs Bunny on Broadway</em>. They show the cartoons and the orchestra plays the music live. That, Hoop can handle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then by all means, you must have an ugly necklace for the evening,&#8221; she said. Elmer&#8217;s fur spiked up again.</p>
  <p>Deena grinned. &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Ding-dong.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>Yikes</em>. She caught Deena&#8217;s eye. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the Avon lady.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do fine. Remember, deep breaths.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; nodded and stood up. Right. Deep breaths. She could do that. <em>No problem</em>.</p>
  <p>In front of her, Elmer was hopping back and forth, tail spiky, once again doing the funky ferret. It was probably all the rage in dance halls on Olympus.</p>
  <p>She ignored him. If he&#8217;d figured out that she was going on a date with a man she really liked, she didn&#8217;t want to know. If he just wanted to play, he could wait for Hale. Right now she had an agenda.</p>
  <p>Right now she had to go let Mr. Midnight into her apartment&#8212;and her life.</p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>Taylor paced in front of the closed door, swinging the bundle of roses he&#8217;d bought from the old man hawking flowers at an intersection. He licked the fingers on his free hand, then tried to control his cowlick, which always seemed to go the wrong direction.</p>
  <p>He doubted he&#8217;d improved the hair situation, but with any luck, he still looked like a fine, upstanding citizen&#8212; the kind of guy any ail-American girl would be nuts about. And from what he could tell, Zo&#235; Smith was about as all-American as they came.</p>
  <p>He cleared his throat and started to tighten the Windsor knot at his throat, then stopped himself. He&#8217;d done both&#8212;the throat clearing and the knot tightening&#8212; about a dozen times during the drive to her apartment. If he pulled the damn noose any tighter, he&#8217;d pass out and Zo&#235; would spend most of their not-a-real-date reviving him with mouth-to-mouth.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Not a bad idea . . .</em>
  </p>
  <p>With a grunt of frustration, he shoved his free hand deep into his pocket. As appealing as mouth-to-mouth might be&#8212;and it was <em>very</em> appealing&#8212;passing out was not a good way to start a date. And even though a prone position would be great sometime before the end of the evening, he sincerely doubted that emergency first aid was going to get Zo&#235; into his bed.</p>
  <p>Absently he leaned against the door, trying to pull himself together. Suave, cool and collected&#8212;that was the ticket. After all, she&#8217;d made it absolutely clear that she didn&#8217;t want the same things from the evening that he did. And since he was determined to work in some very datelike activities, that meant he needed to downshift to suave, pronto.</p>
  <p>Shaking his head, he scowled at the door frame and finger-combed his hair. What was he doing here? A job? A seduction? Both?</p>
  <p>He was still scowling and leaning against the door when it opened. Losing his balance, he tumbled over the threshold and landed in a heap on her hard tile floor, his dozen roses flying free to scatter all over the hall.</p>
  <p>
   <em>So much for a suave, sophisticated entrance.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Her hand flew to her mouth, her eyes crinkling behind her glasses and her body shaking with silent laughter. &#8220;Please,&#8221; she finally said, amusement lacing her voice as she looked down at him. &#8220;Make yourself at home.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He scrambled for a clever retort&#8212;or even a ridiculous one&#8212;but his wit abandoned him. Instead he just sat up, leaning against the wall so he could take in every inch of the woman in the doorway. Had he thought she was beautiful before? He&#8217;d been a fool. She wasn&#8217;t just beautiful; she was spectacular&#8212;the kind of woman that inspired poetry and love songs.</p>
  <p>Too bad he was no poet. And his singing voice sucked.</p>
  <p>Her smile faded as his silence continued. She leaned forward, squinting down at him. &#8220;Taylor? Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221; He forced the word out, needing to move, to get past this stew of awe and first-not-really-a-date jitters. He reached out, pricking his finger on a thorn as his hand curled around a rose. He held it up. &#8220;My lady.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She took it, but didn&#8217;t sniff it. Instead she let it hang at her side as she kept her fingers closed around the stem. <em>Okay.</em> Maybe his all-American Zo&#235; wasn&#8217;t the flower type.</p>
  <p>With a grunt he climbed to his feet, then brushed dust off his rump. &#8220;Do me a favor,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>She tilted her head. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pretend I&#8217;ve just made an entrance worthy of James Bond&#8212;not Jerry Lewis.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Her mouth quirked. &#8220;Well, of course.&#8221; Her blue eye twinkled behind those librarian glasses. &#8220;I just assumed you were trying to give any thugs who might be watching a false sense of security.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pretty clever of me, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Brilliant,&#8221; she said, then batted her eyelashes and pressed a limp hand to her forehead, Southern-belle style. &#8220;And I feel so much safer knowing you&#8217;re here to protect me from the big, bad thuggies.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just doin&#8216; my job, little lady.&#8221; It was a lousy John Wayne impersonation, but her smile grew broader, so he figured it had done the job.</p>
  <p>He glanced around the entrance hall, bending down to check under a little table littered with her mail. &#8220;Seen any thugs around these parts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not a one,&#8221; she said, closing the door. She leaned against the wall and smiled at him. She was sweet and innocent and perfectly polite&#8212;and all he could think about was tasting that mouth and getting her naked. <em>So much for chivalry</em>.</p>
  <p>She licked her lips, and their eyes met. He took a step closer, wondering if that was a spark of interest he saw in her eyes. Hoping it was.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks flushed and she looked away, clearing her throat. &#8220;Uh, no thugs at all.&#8221; She grinned. &#8220;Unless you count Deena.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He blinked. &#8220;Deena?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My beauty consultant,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a girl thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, letting his gaze roam over her. Unlike the other times he&#8217;d seen Zo&#235;, this time she was wearing makeup, and the deep red tint of her lips just about did him in. Every fiber of his body wanted to close his mouth over hers and kiss her&#8212;hard&#8212;until those glossy red lips were smeared under the onslaught. Until she melted in his arms and begged for more.</p>
  <p>With a low groan, he forced his gaze away from her face. The red dress was like nothing he&#8217;d ever seen before, but on her it looked stunning. He didn&#8217;t really care for the odd gold mesh belt&#8212;it looked like a reject from an Austin Powers movie&#8212;but on Zo&#235; it looked perfect.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, pay whatever she&#8217;s charging. You look fantastic.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; She held up the roses. &#8220;And thank you for the flowers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t like them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She frowned. &#8220;Why would you think that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t even smelled that one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, glancing down at the single rose in her hand. &#8220;Right. I can&#8217;t... I&#8217;m not... I&#8217;m&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Allergies,&#8221; said Deena, stepping into the hallway.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; exhaled, her shoulders dropping as if in relief. &#8220;Exactly!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m allergic. Talk about your rotten luck,&#8221; she said, with more enthusiasm than he would&#8217;ve expected from one who was highly allergic. She pressed the rose into Deena&#8217;s hands, scooting another one away with the toe of her shoe.</p>
  <p>Deena stuck her nose down against the flower, then looked back up at Taylor. &#8220;They&#8217;re lovely. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome,&#8221; he said, feeling a tad bewildered. &#8220;Good to see you again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s just leaving,&#8221; Zo&#235; said. She tilted her head toward the door. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deena tossed a knowing grin Taylor&#8217;s way.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Practically out the door,&#8221; she said, and then she was, the door clicking shut firmly behind her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Zo&#235;. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;re alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Something clickity-clacked on the floor behind him, and he turned around. An oversize rat grinned at him, and he forced himself not to think it was bizarre. He turned back to Zo&#235;, aiming his thumb behind him. &#8220;Who&#8217;s the rodent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Elmer.&#8221; She glared at the little guy. &#8220;He&#8217;s a ferret, and he&#8217;s just leaving, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The ferret stood up on his hind legs, whiskers twitching. If Taylor didn&#8217;t know better, he&#8217;d say that was an insolent look on Elmer&#8217;s furry little face.</p>
  <p>Zo&#235; turned toward the ferret, almost prodding him with her eyes. &#8220;I said, he&#8217;s just leaving, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The rodent squeaked, his fur bristled, and then he turned around and clickety-clacked back toward the rest of the apartment.</p>
  <p>Taylor crossed his arms over his chest and grinned. &#8220;Well, well. If it isn&#8217;t Zo&#235; Dolittle. How long have you been talking to animals?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221; She stopped, then scowled. &#8220;I mean, that&#8217;s very clever.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; he said, wondering what she wasn&#8217;t saying. &#8220;That&#8217;s me. Mr. Clever.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re Mr. Midnight,&#8221; she said; then her eyes went wide and she slapped her hand over her mouth. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I just said that,&#8221; she said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Midnight?&#8221; He grinned, taking a step closer. &#8220;I kind of like the sound of that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t mean anything. I&#8217;m just a little&#8221;&#8212;she waved her hand in a circle&#8212;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Nervous, maybe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As if to prove her point, she leaned back against the wall again and ran her tongue over her lips. It was definitely a nervous habit, but as habits went, this one was damned erotic.</p>
  <p>He took a step toward her. &#8220;So tell me, sweetheart, just what do you have to be nervous about?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The look she gave him just about ripped him in half. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious? You.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; He tapped himself on the chest. &#8220;George Bailey Taylor me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She nodded. &#8220;George Bailey Taylor you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He sucked in air, afraid this was some cruel joke fate was playing to teach him not to lust after beautiful women. &#8220;I&#8217;m probably going to regret asking, but why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She tilted her head until her glasses slid down her nose, then peered at him over the rim, her odd-colored gaze giving him the once-over. His body warmed as her eyes roamed over him&#8212;<em>all</em> over him&#8212;and he watched, knowing she was thoroughly checking him out.</p>
  <p>One corner of her mouth curled up into a sensuous little smile that had his body tightening, and he couldn&#8217;t help feeling a tiny bit smug.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because I need a date after all, Mr. Taylor.&#8221; She exhaled&#8212;it was more of a sigh really&#8212;then lifted her head back up to look him in the eye. Her cheeks flushed, and, with a businesslike shove, she pushed her glasses back into place. &#8220;A <em>real</em> date. So tell me. Are you still game?&#8221;</p>
