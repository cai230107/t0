<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_43"></a><b>Chapter 43</b></h1>
<a id="p3115" name="p3115"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3115)">Out on the sea in the darkness, Benito was getting a first-hand lesson in the difference between paying a gondolier to transport you, or telling sailors where you wanted to go, and rowing yourself.</p>
<a id="p3116" name="p3116"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3116)">The first pointed difference was that you actually had to paddle. He was a lot less experienced than Erik, and the coracle was round, which meant they were spending a lot of time spinning slowly. The second difference was that in his previous experience Benito had simply told those in control of the boat his destination, and made finding it their problem. Now it was his and Erik's problem.</p>
<a id="p3117" name="p3117"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3117)">The rain obscured them from enemy watchers, which was a good thing. The trouble was it obscured everything, including possible landmarks.</p>
<a id="p3118" name="p3118"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3118)">At this rate, thought Benito, we might just end up in Albania after all.&#160;</p>
<a id="p3119" name="p3119"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3119)">And they hadn't guessed about the wind or the current or even the chop on the water either. They might just end up <i>swimming</i> to Albania&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;if they didn't end up swimming round and round in circles.</p>
<a id="p3120" name="p3120"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3120)">"I think we're going south," whispered Erik.</p>
<a id="p3121" name="p3121"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3121)">"I thought we planning on going north?"</p>
<a id="p3122" name="p3122"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3122)">Erik grunted. "In this thing we just go where the sea takes us. Bail for a bit."</p>
<a id="p3123" name="p3123"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3123)">So Benito bailed; it made more sense than having him try to paddle. It seemed the sea outside the coracle was keen to get into it as fast as possible. It came aboard in enthusiastic splashes that soon had Benito wet to the skin. Here he was, cheek-by-jowl in a giant bowl with Erik Hakkonsen, and he might as well have been alone on the water. Erik was as silent as a dead man, he couldn't see anything, and Benito was so cold he couldn't feel anything either.</p>
<a id="p3124" name="p3124"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3124)">The whisper came out of the dark again, at his ear, and he jumped. "There's a headland, I think. Help me paddle."</p>
<a id="p3125" name="p3125"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3125)">Gradually the headland loomed up out of the rain. Benito's feet were now ankle-deep in the water in the bottom of the coracle.</p>
<a id="p3126" name="p3126"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3126)">It proved to be an islet. They hauled up on it anyway. But they could vaguely make out a white building off across the water. "I think this must be Mouse Islet," said Benito quietly. "We could see it from the wall. There are some buildings on it."</p>
<a id="p3127" name="p3127"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3127)">"Dawn can't be that far off, Benito. Is that building we can see over there another island?"</p>
<a id="p3128" name="p3128"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3128)">"No. It's a monastery, I think. Just off the mainland jutting into the sea. We could go there, but there's a big inlet ahead. If we go ashore here, we'll be forced to go virtually back into K&eacute;rkira."</p>
<a id="p3129" name="p3129"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3129)">Erik sighed. "We'll be forced back into this bedamned tub instead, then. Come on. Let's get on with it."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3130" name="p3130"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3130)">They did. But it became rapidly obvious that the coracle had suffered during the landing on Mouse Islet. The water was calm here, but Benito had to keep bailing. By the time they got within sight of the further shore, it was a race between water coming in and the bailing and paddling. Of course, the more water there was in the vessel the heavier it was to row, and the slower they went, too. Benito started preparing himself to swim.</p>
<a id="p3131" name="p3131"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3131)">It proved unnecessary. Just.</p>
<a id="p3132" name="p3132"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3132)"><i>Mind you</i>, Benito thought, <i>my clothes are so wet by now that I can't really get any wetter.</i> Despite the exercise, Benito was shivering almost uncontrollably. At least the rain had stopped, but there was still a cold wind blowing.</p>
<a id="p3133" name="p3133"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3133)">"I don't think it is worth hiding that&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;bathtub," said Erik. "We won't be using it to get back, so we might as well just get away from here."</p>
<a id="p3134" name="p3134"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3134)">The darkness was still thick as they blundered off into it. Even Benito, used to "seeing" his way around by feel in the darkness of Venice's nighttime rooftops, found the going difficult. Man-made structures had the decency to be at predictable angles! Then his nose picked up something. A hint of wood-smoke.</p>
<a id="p3135" name="p3135"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3135)">"There's a fire ahead," whispered Benito.</p>
<a id="p3136" name="p3136"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3136)">Erik snorted. "I know. I've been trying to stalk it, with something stumbling along just behind me that makes more noise than a pair of bull-seals having a territory fight in the middle of a Venetian glass-shop. If it's local peasants, we need to ask them some directions. And if it's Hungarian soldiers, we need to avoid them if we can."</p>
<a id="p3137" name="p3137"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3137)">Benito shivered. "Right now I'd be happy to go and ask them if I could borrow their fire for a bit."</p>
<a id="p3138" name="p3138"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3138)">"Well, come along. But try to keep it quiet! If it is soldiery, we are staying out of a fight. You're too keen on fighting."</p>
<a id="p3139" name="p3139"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3139)">But when they got closer, and Erik worked out just what the two Croats were doing, it was he, not Benito, who rushed in to the kill. The two Croats weren't well positioned to resist.</p>
<a id="p3140" name="p3140"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3140)">By the time Benito got there with his Shetlander dagger in hand, Erik was already kneeling next to the woman, untying her; and a moment later, he was undoing the gag.</p>
<a id="p3141" name="p3141"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3141)">Her first response was to scream.</p>
<a id="p3142" name="p3142"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3142)">"Hush!" hissed Erik.</p>
<a id="p3143" name="p3143"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3143)">He might as well have tried to stop a storm with his hands. She had a proper breath now for the next hysterical scream. It was understandable. Besides being raped, she was covered in her erstwhile rapist's blood. When someone's head is more or less summarily removed by a hatchet, they bleed. A lot.</p>
<a id="p3144" name="p3144"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3144)">But understandable as it might be, she was probably telling everyone within a mile that there was a woman here. Even the Croats' horses were shifting nervously. Benito shoved Erik aside, hauled her up by what was left of her blouse, and slapped her. "Shut up!" he hissed. "We're rescuing you. You want others to come?"</p>
<a id="p3145" name="p3145"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3145)">She shut up. Erik cut her hands free. "Now we'd better run. Someone must have heard that scream."</p>
<a id="p3146" name="p3146"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3146)">"What about taking their horses?" asked Benito. "They're tied over there." He pointed with his chin.</p>
<a id="p3147" name="p3147"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3147)">Erik looked. "Good. That's the first bit of luck we've had."</p>
<a id="p3148" name="p3148"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3148)">The horses still had their tack on. It was plain that the two soldiers had slipped off from somewhere else for a little private pleasure. "You're lighter than I am. You take her," said Erik, pushing the staggering woman toward Benito.</p>
<a id="p3149" name="p3149"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3149)">"Uh. I don't ride so well, Erik."</p>
<a id="p3150" name="p3150"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3150)">"Oh, hell. She'd better come with me, then. Help her up behind me."</p>
<a id="p3151" name="p3151"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3151)">Benito did. She clung to Erik like ivy. It was just light enough now for Benito to see her huge, terrified eyes. He was then left with the difficulty of getting onto the horse himself. It kept moving every time he put a foot in the stirrup. Finally, in desperation, he jumped. He nearly went clear over the other side, but did manage to cling to the saddle. He pulled himself upright into it. He managed to find one stirrup. It was too long. This was a whole continent away from the <i>Haute Ecole Equestrienne</i> Petro Dorma had sent him to. There, he'd been surrounded by respectful grooms, docile mounts and mounting blocks.</p>
<a id="p3152" name="p3152"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3152)">But he had to try. Erik was already out of sight. The horse plainly knew it had a total amateur in the saddle. It was being as balky as only a horse can be, when it knows it has mastery of the rider.</p>
<a id="p3153" name="p3153"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3153)">There was a clatter of hooves behind him. Benito prepared to jump. Only his foot was now stuck in this damned stirrup. If he jumped he'd drag&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;He hunched in the saddle and struggled with his foot.</p>
<a id="p3154" name="p3154"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3154)">"Get a move on, Benito," snapped Erik. The clatter had come from him, returning to see what had happened to Benito. He slapped the rump of Benito's horse and the vile animal took off as if someone had shoved something red-hot in an unmentionable spot. With Benito swearing and clinging to the saddle, they headed upward into the rougher terrain. At least his horse was following Erik's now.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3155" name="p3155"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3155)">By the time they reached the ridgeline, the sun was just burning its way through the clouds. Benito had long since abandoned any pretense of "riding." He was just trying to stay on the Godforsaken animal. It took all his finely honed burglar's acrobatic skills to do so, and all his strength, too. He'd managed to get his foot free of the stirrup, at last. That meant when he fell off&#151;not if, but when&#151;he could try to fall clear.</p>
<a id="p3156" name="p3156"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3156)">When they got up to some pines on the ridge, Erik called a halt. More precisely, he pulled his horse to a halt, and Benito's horse stopped also.</p>
<a id="p3157" name="p3157"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3157)">Very abruptly. Benito continued for a few yards without it.</p>
<a id="p3158" name="p3158"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3158)">He got to his feet, to find the Icelander looking at him, his shoulders shaking with laughter. "Why didn't you say<i> </i>you couldn't ride at all, you crazy kid!"</p>
<a id="p3159" name="p3159"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3159)">"Uh. I <i>have </i>been to classes. <i>Case Vecchie</i> can all ride, but, well, I was a bridge-brat, Erik." Defensively: "I've only ridden a horse about five or six times before this, you know."</p>
<a id="p3160" name="p3160"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3160)">Erik snorted. "Well, you can't count this as another time. I've seen a sack of meal do a better job of it. And those things hanging down are stirrups. You are supposed to put your feet in them."</p>
<a id="p3161" name="p3161"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3161)">"I couldn't reach them."</p>
<a id="p3162" name="p3162"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3162)">Erik shook his head. "We'll shorten them now. Help this poor woman down, Benito."</p>
<a id="p3163" name="p3163"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3163)">Benito did. She almost fell off the horse&#151;and then pushed away from him. "Who are you?" she asked warily, her eyes darting looking for a place to run. There was naked fear in that voice.</p>
<a id="p3164" name="p3164"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3164)">Benito waved his hands at her, trying to look helpful and harmless at the same time. "We're Venetians." It was easier than trying to explain. "You're safe now."</p>
<a id="p3165" name="p3165"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3165)">The young woman crumpled and began to cry. Then she started speaking Greek. At speed.</p>
<a id="p3166" name="p3166"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3166)">"Whoa." Benito squatted down beside her; it seemed it was up to him to try to calm her down. Well, he was smaller than Erik; maybe that made him look less threatening. "We don't speak Greek," he said gently. "I can't help you if I don't understand."</p>
<a id="p3167" name="p3167"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3167)">"They killed Georgio!" she wailed&#151;but softly, hardly more than a whisper. "They&#151;they&#151;" she dissolved into tears, and Benito patted her shoulder, thinking that trying to hold her would probably be a bad idea at this point.</p>
<a id="p3168" name="p3168"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3168)">She got herself under control, a lot faster than he would have thought. "What happened?" he asked. "Why did you come down out of the hills?"</p>
<a id="p3169" name="p3169"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3169)">She gulped for air. "See, some of the goats were missing. He thought they'd gone home. So he went down to the house. And when he didn't come back I went down to look for him. He was&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p3170" name="p3170"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3170)">Her eyes were round with the memory of things Benito didn't want to think about. "They were torturing him. Burning him to get him to tell them where he'd hidden the money." She shuddered, then said, plaintively, "We don't <i>have</i> any money. Just a few pennies. We've only been married for two months."</p>
<a id="p3171" name="p3171"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3171)">She began to cry again; great heaving sobs, wringing her hands together so hard that her knuckles were bone-white. Then she caught her breath. She seemed determined to tell them; to get the vileness out. "I ran in to try and help him. The one&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;the one who&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;he said: 'Here's the bitch. We'll get it out of her instead.' They cut Georgio's throat. They cut my man's throat like you would butcher a hog."</p>
<a id="p3172" name="p3172"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3172)">"Here." Erik had produced a small, squat bottle. "Manfred gave me some of his armor polish. Give her a drink, Benito."</p>
<a id="p3173" name="p3173"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3173)">Benito did. She choked, but then drank some more. The woman looked at Erik. "At least you killed them."</p>
<a id="p3174" name="p3174"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3174)">Erik looked decidedly uncomfortable. "Look. Is there anyone we can take you to? Somewhere safe where they'll look after you?"</p>
<a id="p3175" name="p3175"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3175)">She laughed bitterly. It was a horrible, tragic sound. "Safe! Safe like you Venetians sitting in your fortress. There is nowhere safe for the poor peasants. We must hide in the hills."</p>
<a id="p3176" name="p3176"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3176)">"So&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;there is no one we can take you to?" Erik persisted, but without much hope.</p>
<a id="p3177" name="p3177"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3177)">She shrugged. "I have a brother on a galley at sea. Georgio's parents are somewhere in the hills." She looked at both of them with resignation, as if she was perfectly prepared for them to abandon her.</p>
<a id="p3178" name="p3178"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3178)">Erik cleared his throat, and looked worriedly back down the hill. "Look. We have to get on. I've got to get to Count Dentico's villa. My&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;my&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;a lady&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;I must go and see if she's all right. But we can't just leave you here."</p>
<a id="p3179" name="p3179"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3179)">"I have nowhere to go," she repeated tonelessly.</p>
<a id="p3180" name="p3180"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3180)">Erik cocked a wary ear toward the slope. "Then you'd better come with us until we find a place for you. Benito, let's shorten those stirrups. And try holding on with your knees."</p>
<a id="p3181" name="p3181"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3181)">Benito shook his head. "Erik, the only thing I wasn't holding on with were my teeth. And that was only because the mane kept bouncing around when I tried to bite it."</p>
<a id="p3182" name="p3182"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3182)">The Greek peasant woman managed a tremulous laugh. "I can ride. My uncle was a groom for Count Di Valva. The Count wasn't there very often. Where is this place you wish to find? I can probably get you in the right direction, at least." Underneath her shock and her grief, she was recovering some hope, and only because they had not offered to abandon her.</p>
<a id="p3183" name="p3183"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3183)">Erik nodded. "You ride, then. Benito can cling on like a tick behind you. The estate is somewhere near a place called Giannades. Do you have any idea where that is?"</p>
<a id="p3184" name="p3184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3184)">She nodded. "I haven't been there. But it is to the west of K&eacute;rkira."</p>
<a id="p3185" name="p3185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3185)">She went over to the horse and shortened the stirrups quickly and efficiently; clearly she knew what she was doing. Then she hitched up her skirts in a most unladylike but very practical way, and mounted with an ease that Benito envied.</p>
<a id="p3186" name="p3186"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3186)">"It's best that she does something," Erik said, quietly. "She's ready to go to pieces, Benito. She's like a glass that's cracked to bits; one touch, and she'll shatter."</p>
<a id="p3187" name="p3187"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3187)">"I'm not surprised."</p>
<a id="p3188" name="p3188"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3188)">Erik sighed worriedly. "That could be what happened to my Svanhild. Come on, let's go. If you look over at K&eacute;rkira, you'll see Emeric has troops coming in by the column. That's a good few thousand men down there. We should move before they get too organized, never mind before they notice a couple of missing Croats."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3189" name="p3189"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3189)">Caesare Aldanto's body slept. Long, long ago Chernobog had learned this was a necessity. They died quickly if you did not allow them to rest.</p>
<a id="p3190" name="p3190"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3190)">Caesare lay on a cot in the tent that had been allocated to him, and twitched occasionally, as a dog might when dreaming.</p>
<a id="p3191" name="p3191"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3191)"><i>Chernobog's other dog, yellow and feral, prowled the hills. The shaman had been told to look for holy places, to sniff them out so they could be rededicated.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3192" name="p3192"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3192)"><i>It should have been easy. It was proving impossible. The smell of magic was easy enough to find. The trouble was&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;everywhere reeked of it. Up in the wind-tumbled sky his two aerial eyes flew hither and yon, looking for groves. Or temples. Or even standing stones.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3193" name="p3193"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3193)"><i>So far, all he'd seen through their infinite detail-seeing eyes were churches. The shaman-dog shivered, thinking about those. His master could and no doubt would rededicate some of those to his purpose, but it was a dangerous process, and there was that about them which struck at him. He could, of course, strike back&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but that could easily draw the attention of the master's adversary. And the shaman was not ready for that.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3194" name="p3194"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3194)"><i>The shaman-dog stumbled and sneezed. Pollen. It seemed as if every plant on this accursed island was flowering. Like the magic of this place, the pollen was in the air everywhere.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3195" name="p3195"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3195)">He left the roadway in haste. Horses, and a double-span of donkeys struggling to drag a heavy cannon, were coming along it. Horses took a great aversion to this body-form. They would smell him out and chase and kick him if they could. This road was busy with troops and cannons coming along it. By evening at least a third of the guns would be in place. Already the pounding thunder was beginning. The shaman wrinkled his nose in distaste. He didn't like the smell of gunpowder either. It was a new thing. The shaman hated new things.&#160;</p>
