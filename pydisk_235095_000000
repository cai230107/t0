<a id="p2104" name="p2104"></a>    <p onmouseover="PNo(2104)" class="About&#160;the&#160;Authors"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Lloyd Biggle, Jr., Ph.D., (1923â€“2002)</span> was a musician, author, and internationally known oral historian. He began writing professionally in 1955, and became a full-time writer with the publication of his novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">All the Colors of Darkness</span>, in 1963, a profession that he followed until his death. Both Dr. Biggle's science fiction and mystery stories have received inter&shy;national acclaim. He was celebrated in science fiction circles as the author who introduced aesthetics into a literature known for its scientific and technological complications. He published two dozen books as well as magazine stories and articles beyond count. His most recent novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chronicide Mission</span>. He was writing almost to the moment of his death. "I can write them faster than the magazines can publish them," he once said, with the result that even though his &shy;writing has been stilled, his publications will continue until his backlog of stories is exhausted.</p>
