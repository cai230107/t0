             "Waves are now at least twenty feet," Sandra said to me, the 
        Diana's bow often completely disappearing into the swells now.  I 
        nodded,  well  aware of the fact that although  the  Diana  could 
        withstand  far greater waves bows on, turning the ship  into  the 
        "trough" of the waves could spell disaster for us all if the ship 
        was ever tilted more than forty five degrees from the horizontal.  
        The "roll" of the ship due to taking the waves on her port  quar-
        ter  was  something that worried me just a bit here.   The  "roll 
        limit" for the Diana was no more than forty five degrees, and  we 
        were  at  times going almost thirty right now!   Headed  straight 
        into the waves there was no problem, but we couldn't continue  on 
        the  course we were on now without risking a "roll over"  if  the 
        sea  got up much more than what it was!  I'd ridden  through  one 
        storm  this size aboard the North Star with Queen Maris  in  com-
        mand, and she'd been forced to drop sea anchors and ride it out!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Darlanis  and the others have been forced to heave  to,"  I 
        answered, well aware of the latest report of the midshipman , al-
        though  I  still had the power yet to smash through  these  waves 
        like  a  battering ram!  The Diana could handle  anything  nature 
        could throw at her!  She was superior to any surface ship built!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They will drift to leewards faster than we will," she said.  
        The  storm  filling the sky there ahead of us.  I could  see  the 
        flash of lightning, even heard the "rumble" now of the thunder...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They know where we're heading," I answered, the view  quite 
        blurred  there through the glass covered forward  viewing  slits.  
        At times now the visibility was cut completely back to "zero"!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We need to cut back on the engines," Sandra said to me.   I 
        could  tell that she was "scared", perhaps more so as she  didn't 
        really "understand" the Diana that well.  How "strong" it was...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That's  the last thing we want to do now," I answered,  or-
        dering  the helmsman to steer directly into the storm so that  we 
        took the waves straight on.  The Diana's motions now changing  to 
        just a simple up and down, the stress on the hull muchly reduced!
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Go  below," I said, the girl nodding thankfully, the  water 
        running off her, her uniform as wet as if she'd been in swimming!  
        When the Diana smashed through a wave now the spray came up  over 
        the  entire  forward  part of the ship!   Fortunately  the  water 
        wasn't  very cold this time of year, although the impact  of  the 
        spray against our bodies was enough to fling us back against  the 
        railing as the entire forward part of the ship disappeared into a 
        wave!  I estimated wave height at nearly twenty five feet, higher 
        than I'd ever seen before in all the times that I'd been at sea!!  
        The crack of the thunder and the flash of the lightning reminding 
        me of heavy gunfire back in another era now only myth and legend.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Going  to get worse before it gets better!" Sandra said  to 
        me  in a half yell, the "slam" of the waves against  the  Diana's 
        armored  hull making the ship creak and groan.  Given the  nature 
        of the battleship's construction, I wasn't concerned with  damage 
        as  such, as the Diana could withstand any "sea" as long  as  she 
        was  headed into them.  Trying to turn the ship however would  be 
        flirting with disaster, especially since the Diana's upper  armor 
        made her somewhat "top-heavy" as compared to any sailing ship...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'll check around," I said, leaving her standing there.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The interior of the Diana was like walking through a shower.  
        The dripping water everywhere as seawater leaked around the upper 
        hatches.   While such water didn't "hurt" anything,  the  Diana's 
        own pumps, driven by her triple steam boilers, being able to han-
        dle it, there would be "work" for the crew later in greasing down 
        everything  and seeing that rust didn't start eating away at  us!  
        The men and women of the crew in the semi-darkness of the interi-
        or  like lost souls clinging to the interior of the ship,  a  few 
        swinging lamps our only illumination here inside the battleship.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "How  `bad'  is it?" the engineer asked,  her  eyes  holding 
        mine.  She was a "competent" woman, her caste that of the  Build-
        ers.   She  had  been Jard Sandar's assistant ever  since  I  had 
        killed  the first one for his "treason" against us.    I  thought 
        rather  highly of her, although it still seemed a bit strange  to 
        see a woman doing such things that one would expect a man to  do.  
        Daris Adara was married, a mother, a gold chain about her  throat 
        marking her as such.  Her husband a Physician in Arsana, I under-
        stood.  I supposed he liked the exotic sound of her name as  much 
        as I did.  They had a slave girl, like most well to do couples...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Not  good," I answered in a low voice.  "We've been  forced 
        to  head  directly into the storm to cut the roll  down,"  I  ex-
        plained to Daris, seeing her nod.  After the storm was over  we'd 
        have to head back towards land, our present course being  towards 
        Japan, although we lacked the "fuel range" to travel that far...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We've  already had a couple minor injuries from the  roll," 
        she  answered, the halter she wore plastered to her breasts,  her 
        bare midriff and shorts more the attire of another sort of woman.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'll see what I can do," I replied, giving her a smile.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Engine  number two one half reverse," I said,  Sandra  nod-
        ding, pushing the repeater to one half back, although I was  well 
        aware  she  didn't understand the reasoning here.  With  one  and 
        three  one half forward, number two half reverse, we  would  slow 
        the  Diana but still keep the ship pointed into the  waves.   The 
        almost constant "crack" of the thunder echoing through the hull.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Took the `strain' off her," Sandra said a moment later, the 
        ship  now slowly moving into the waves, the pressure of wind  and 
        wave against the hull such that we were hardly moving forward...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Let's just hope the other ships `survived' this," I said.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I  watched  the  moonlight on the waves  as  the  Diana  cut 
        through  the water, the sea still high, but nothing like  it  had 
        been  earlier.  Except for some minor burns caused  by  stumbling 
        against the hot boilers and steam pipes, we'd come through  fine.  
        The Diana having "proved" herself in a way no one could doubt.  I 
        was now again running at one half ahead on all three engines, our 
        speed about seven knots or so against these heavy swells we  were 
        now smashing our way through.  There had been no sign of the oth-
        er ships, Sandra having said that it was likely that they'd  been 
        blown back into the strait and would have to work their way back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Call me if needed," I said to Sandra, "And get some  `rest' 
        yourself," I added, seeing her nod.  She was a good captain.  Not 
        I  thought  one  like  Maris  or  perhaps  myself,  but  she  was 
        "capable", and that was all that really counted here right now...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I expect you were thinking how `nice' it was there on  Lor-
        raine's estate, weren't you?" I teased Kathi as the slave nodded.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I fear I am not a `sailor'," Kathi smiled, her eyes warm.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "But you know how to `pleasure' one," I smiled, undoing  her 
        halter, dropping it to the table, cupping her full firm breasts.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "One  and three full stop, two slow ahead," I  ordered,  the 
        Diana  slowly creeping into the bay.  Ahead of us a boat, men  at 
        the oars, a man tossing the lead.  The chart showed ample  water, 
        but such charts often are not that "accurate" either, I'll  note.  
        The hot late summer sun shining down upon the armored battleship.  
        A  few  clouds like puffs of cotton slowly drifting  towards  the 
        east.  We'd seen nothing yet of the other ships, but I was fairly 
        sure  that they probably had survived the storm  considering  the 
        way the wind had been blowing and where the strait was that sepa-
        rated Dularn from the mainland.  There would be ample "work"  for 
        everyone,  both  chopping wood for the boilers  to  conserve  our 
        coal,  and  repainting the upper hull where the  paint  had  been 
        washed  off by the force of the waves we'd endured two days  ago.  
        "Drop  both forward anchors!" I snapped a moment later,  the  an-
        chors  slipping into the still waters of the bay with  a  splash.  
        "Have a boat take an anchor out astern," I added, Sandra nodding.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Like some great sea monster," Kathi said to me, shading her 
        eyes as we stood there on shore looking out at the Diana  resting 
        quietly above her reflection.  Men and women scrambling over  the 
        hull, tied by ropes to the "backbone" that ran the length of  the 
        ship.   As I've mentioned before, the Diana is designed  to  look 
        something like a "sea monster", a bit of "psychology" I'd  stolen 
        from Lorraine's earlier painting of her Squala as a great  shark.  
        Some fishermen from a local village having arrived shortly  after 
        we'd  anchored with a number of items they wished to sell to  us.  
        A  couple of wenches with them who saw some "silver" to be  made.  
        In  a society where "sex" and "reproduction" are now two  totally 
        and entirely "different" things people now look upon such matters 
        much differently than one of the 20th Century might do so here.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm going to check the underside of the hull," I told  her.  
        That  would also give me the "chance" to try out our  new  under-
        water breathing equipment that I'd perfected a short time before.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'll take a dive with you," Kathi smiled, her eyes glowing.  
        The blonde being a strong swimmer, with excellent lungs, I knew.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             A few fish scurried out of the way as I swam beneath the an-
        chored  Diana,  the great hull like the shadow of a  sea  monster 
        over me.  The breathing mask allowing me to both see and breathe.  
        Kathi  beside me, completely naked but for her strap  and  clips, 
        the  golden collar about her throat, the bubbles rising  up  like 
        silvery  bells from her own breathing mask.  Our crude swim  fins 
        sending  us beneath the battleship.  The leather hoses that  sup-
        plied us with air curving back behind to the surface of the bay.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I worked my way back towards the stern, Kathi beside me, her 
        bleached  hair floating about her head, the planking of the  hull 
        up overhead making me much aware that the Diana was  "vulnerable" 
        from  underneath, although since the hull was made of oak  planks 
        six inches thick it'd take some drilling to make a hole in  it...  
        The three great bronze screws motionless in the water just  ahead 
        of us, gleaming in the filtered rays of the sun almost like gold.
