<a id="p4522" name="p4522"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4522)" style="text-indent:0">"It is well that war is so terrible, or we should get too fond of it."</p>

<a id="p4524" name="p4524"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4524)">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p4525" name="p4525"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4525)">It was good to be together with her lovers again, Kendra thought. Or maybe "at last" was more accurate. She found she was comfortable with Marta now. They were together in Marta's huge bed, gasping and sweating from electric exertions. In the bare few seconds between sex and conversation, she reflected on the events of the last few segs.</p>
<a id="p4526" name="p4526"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4526)">Marta had tensed as Rob entered her, but seemed to relax immediately. Her muscles and sinews had stood out clearly as she screamed in pleasure and that was a clear indication that her emotional scars were healing. Nor had Kendra protested when Mar dragged her into a scorching embrace. Mingled scents, tastes, the feathery touches of hair and questing lips and fingers that she used to find sensuous were now orgasmic in intensity and she neither knew nor cared which of them was exciting her.</p>
<a id="p4527" name="p4527"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4527)">Eventually words were spoken, interrupting her thoughts, along with long kisses and stretching. "Thank you, love," Marta said to her, hugging her close. "I feel a lot better."</p>
<a id="p4528" name="p4528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4528)">"I'm glad," she replied. </p>
<a id="p4529" name="p4529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4529)">Rob gathered them both in and held them. "That was better than I remembered&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but my memory is a bit shaky. Better remind me often," he grinned at the dark humor.</p>
<a id="p4530" name="p4530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4530)">Marginally uncomfortable, Kendra asked, "So, what are you planning? You mentioned something?"</p>
<a id="p4531" name="p4531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4531)">"I got a contract with Lawjin Orbital. They need a system installation monitored and renovation of the surviving equipment. I'll be supervising the other contractors," he explained. "It's a start and I'm sure there'll be repair work to be done. I was going to apply for a pilot slot with Higgins Recovery, but&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." He tapered off. He'd never fly again. He had no implant for high-performance craft and was subject to occasional disorientation. He could perhaps fly a private craft over empty wilderness, if he felt suicidal.</p>
<a id="p4532" name="p4532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4532)">Marta said, "And I got lucky. Bellefontaine is back in business. They agreed to take me on a month-to-month contract. I'll be hostessing and doing guest escort. As soon as the nets are completely back, I've got an ad in place. I lowered my rates to start with, but I'll boost them again as soon as possible. There'll still be a market for my pictorial work, although outsystem is harder to collect on.""Are you okay with Bellefontaine?" Kendra asked, gripping her hand.</p>
<a id="p4533" name="p4533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4533)">"I'm fine, love," Marta assured her. "Really. Occasional nightmares," she admitted, "but no conscious problems. How about you?"</p>
<a id="p4534" name="p4534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4534)">"I'm okay," Kendra agreed. Mostly because she'd seen what happened to Marta and realized the difference in scale. And one did get used to pain with practice, but she wasn't going to say that. "I'm glad the UN did pay my back pay, but considering how much hassle it was to get that out of them when I said I wasn't going back, I'm really glad I didn't. It's a decent chunk of cash. I'm on orders through the end of the year. After that, I don't know.</p>
<a id="p4535" name="p4535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4535)">"Maybe I'll take up gardening." </p>
<a id="p4536" name="p4536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4536)">&#160;</p>
