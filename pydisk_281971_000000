<a id="p528" name="p528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(528)" style="text-indent:0"><i>When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not hereditary.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p529" name="p529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(529)" align="right" style="text-indent:0">&#151;Thomas Paine</p>

<a id="p530" name="p530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(530)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p531" name="p531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(531)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p532" name="p532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(532)">Walter saw the distant flash of a telescope several times that morning, which didn't surprise him: He'd seen an occasional rider paralleling their course for days; the nearer they got to Home, the more intense the scrutiny.</p>
<a id="p533" name="p533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(533)">He nodded in silent approval and rode on, noticing with some pride that none of the others had caught it. The Home watchers were taking some pains to keep their attention inconspicuous.</p>
<a id="p534" name="p534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(534)">Still, by the time Walter, Ahira, and their dwarvish escort reached the top of the ridge overlooking the valley that the elves called Varnath, Walter felt like he'd been thoroughly frisked.</p>
<a id="p535" name="p535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(535)"><i>A simple "Assume the position" would have sufficed, guys.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p536" name="p536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(536)">Not that Walter Slovotsky had anything against deviousness&#151;in fact, he preferred it, all things being equal&#151;but there was a time for a simple confrontation.</p>
<a id="p537" name="p537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(537)">If it'd been his show&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p538" name="p538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(538)"><i>Then again, it's not my show. </i>Not anymore. Not even to the extent that it was when he was seconding Karl, back in the old days when they were on a raiding team together.</p>
<a id="p539" name="p539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(539)">He didn't yearn for that time, not really. Food was eaten cold, then, for fear that the slavers would see a cooking fire; they had to sleep lightly, remembering the face of a man who hadn't. Those had been days of strain and nights wrenched in fear, all the time hoping, praying, that the next man doomed to fall to the ground, clutching at the crossbow bolt protruding from his mouth, <i>was </i>the next man, not Emma Slovotsky's baby boy.</p>
<a id="p540" name="p540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(540)">No, he didn't miss the fighting.</p>
<a id="p541" name="p541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(541)">But there had been a certain something to those days, something that the last years just hadn't had. Something hard to put a finger on.</p>
<a id="p542" name="p542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(542)">Maybe it was that the heartbeats seemed stronger when you could hear each and every one, Walter decided. That was it.</p>
<a id="p543" name="p543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(543)">And he cursed himself for an idiot. "There is an old Chinese curse, 'May you live in interesting times,' " he muttered to himself, before remembering that, after all, foolish consistency was the hobgoblin of little minds.</p>
<a id="p544" name="p544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(544)">That made him feel better; Walter Slovotsky didn't want to risk the size of his mind by being unnecessarily consistent.</p>
<a id="p545" name="p545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(545)">"There's also an old American saying," Ahira said. "Goes like this: 'People who talk to themselves are a bit loose between the eardrums.' "</p>
<a id="p546" name="p546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(546)">Slovotsky dug his heels in a bit deeper and kicked his horse into a half-canter, smiling quietly to himself as the dwarves behind him cursed, spurring their own mounts. Dwarves and horses&#151;even well-tempered ponies like Geveren and the rest of their escort were riding&#151;were renowned for not getting along.</p>
<a id="p547" name="p547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(547)">"You're a mean man, Walter Slovotsky," Ahira said, bouncing along on the back of his animal. He was the only dwarf to ride a full-sized horse, although he and his gray gelding didn't seem to like each other's company particularly well.</p>
<a id="p548" name="p548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(548)">Then again, that was Ahira: He always seemed to pick a gray gelding that he didn't get along particularly well with. His swearing at his horse seemed almost as much a part of the dwarf as the clanking of the patched chainmail vest and the huge, double-bladed battleaxe strapped to his saddle.</p>
<a id="p549" name="p549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(549)">Nothing ever remains quite the same; there had been a time when Ahira carried a smaller axe, strapping it across his absurdly broad chest. He had traded that axe in on a bigger one, one that was almost the size he was.</p>
<a id="p550" name="p550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(550)">"Hey, Walter, doesn't that look like&#151;" The dwarf's homely face creased in puzzlement, then broke into a broad smile. "It is! <i>Wheeee!</i>"</p>
<a id="p551" name="p551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(551)">"Huh?"</p>
<a id="p552" name="p552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(552)">"At the customs house&#151;it is!" Swearing, the dwarf kicked his horse into a full canter.</p>
<a id="p553" name="p553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(553)">The oversized log cabin that stood as the Home customs station was only a blur near the horizon to Slovotsky, but Ahira must have seen something. Clearly, it wasn't anything to worry about, or Ahira would have sounded some sort of alarm, but&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p554" name="p554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(554)">Slovotsky stood in the saddle and called out to the dwarf who was driving the flatbed wagon.</p>
<a id="p555" name="p555"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(555)">"Hey, Geveren," he said, putting the accent firmly on the first syllable of the dwarf's name, "I'm going to go catch up with Ahira. Take a <i>little </i>time, if you need to&#151;"</p>
<a id="p556" name="p556"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(556)">"Just a <i>small </i>amount," Geveren said, a gap-toothed smile peeking through his beard. "Only a <i>short </i>while."</p>
<a id="p557" name="p557"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(557)">Slovotsky's short jokes didn't bother the dwarves; to them, they were the right height, and humans were stretched vertically, although not as badly as elves.</p>
<a id="p558" name="p558"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(558)">"&#151;but you bring the rest in," Slovotsky finished. Then, remembering that none of these dwarves had ever been to Home before, he added, "And be prepared to put up with a thorough inspection at customs without taking offense&#151;I don't want to hear about your giving the inspectors any trouble."</p>
<a id="p559" name="p559"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(559)">The dwarf smiled, nodded, and waved; Slovotsky spurred his horse after Ahira.</p>
<a id="p560" name="p560"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(560)">By the time Slovotsky's mare had gotten herself worked up to a full gallop, they were almost at the customs house. Ahira seemed to be wrestling with some human, while another, holding a flintlock carbine at the ready, looked on.</p>
<a id="p561" name="p561"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(561)">One hand on a pistol, Slovotsky brought the horse to a quick halt and vaulted out of the saddle, only to see that Ahira was hugging a full-sized human, a boy perhaps fifteen or so; tall and a bit gangly, he awkwardly patted the dwarf's back&#151;</p>
<a id="p562" name="p562"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(562)">"Son of a bitch&#151;Jason Cullinane!" Slovotsky dropped his hand away from the pistol's butt, noticing how the guard relaxed only microscopically, only lowering the hammer of his carbine when a strangely familiar metal rattling issued from the interior of the customs house.</p>
<a id="p563" name="p563"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(563)">A grizzled face leaned out and nodded. "Greetings, Walter Slovotsky and Ahira. You are welcome Home."</p>
<a id="p564" name="p564"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(564)">"Betcher ass," Slovotsky said, then switched back to Erendra. "That is, I thank you. It's good to be back."</p>
<a id="p565" name="p565"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(565)">The dwarf released the boy and turned to Walter. "Can you believe how much he's grown? Last time we saw him, he was tiny."</p>
<a id="p566" name="p566"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(566)">Slovotsky nodded. "Damn, but he wasn't much taller than this," he said, winking at Jason as he held his hand half a foot above Ahira's head.</p>
<a id="p567" name="p567"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(567)">"You'll pay for that, Slovotsky," the dwarf said, with patently false menace.</p>
<a id="p568" name="p568"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(568)">Jason walked over to Walter and held out a hand. "Hello, Uncle Walter," he said, perhaps a bit stiffly. The grip was firm, but it was clear that the boy was trying too hard. No problem&#151;he was just growing faster up than outside, and probably faster outside than inside. It looked like he might easily end up as tall as his father; right now, his eyes were almost on Slovotsky's level.</p>
<a id="p569" name="p569"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(569)">Slovotsky shook his head. "A handshake is just not going to make it, kiddo." He seized Jason in a bear hug, sighing to himself when the boy's returning grip was only perfunctory.</p>
<a id="p570" name="p570"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(570)">"Damn, but it's good to see you, boy. How's everyone?" he asked as he let Jason go.</p>
<a id="p571" name="p571"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(571)">Jason smiled. "Just fine, as of a couple of tendays ago." He pursed his lips for a moment. "I'm sure that Mom and Dad would have wanted me to&#151;"</p>
<a id="p572" name="p572"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(572)">"Sure, sure, and pass our best wishes along, when you see them. Which'll be when?"</p>
<a id="p573" name="p573"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(573)">Jason shrugged. "Another couple tendays. Ellegon's supposed to pick up some supplies here for Daven's team, and pick up Valeran&#151;"</p>
<a id="p574" name="p574"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(574)">Slovotsky smiled. "Val's here? I haven't seen him since we gave your father the crown." A good man to have around in a fight. Or just to drink with.</p>
<a id="p575" name="p575"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(575)">Jason frowned. "Dad has him baby-sitting me," he said, making it evident that he didn't think he needed any watching. He brightened. "And teaching me swordsmanship, too. In any case, Ellegon's supposed to pick him and Bren and&#151;"</p>
<a id="p576" name="p576"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(576)">"Bren Adahan? The Holtish baron?"</p>
<a id="p577" name="p577"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(577)">Jason whistled in irritation at being interrupted again. "Yes, <i>him. </i>Dad has him here, partly to be taught by Lou Riccetti, but mainly to keep an eye on me, like Valeran does." The boy tried to shrug away the notion that he needed watching over. "I don't have to put up with it for much longer. Then Ellegon will pick up Valeran and me on his way out; we're going to be his tenders while he makes a sweep to Ehvenor and then back Home. Now, what are you two doing here?"</p>
<a id="p578" name="p578"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(578)">Walter tried to smile disarmingly. "Whatsamatter, boyo, aren't you glad to see us?" he asked, trying to change the subject. Jason's was a hard question to answer honestly, and Walter had no intention of doing so.</p>
<a id="p579" name="p579"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(579)">Anything involving Walter and Ahira's plans to skulk around Pandathaway had to be handled on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<a id="p580" name="p580"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(580)">Jason didn't.</p>
<a id="p581" name="p581"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(581)">Walter had no intention of telling Jason that he and Ahira were going to pick up some trade goods to take to Pandathaway to sell while they were trying to dig up word of either what Ahrmin was up to or what Ahrmin thought Karl was up to; if a rumor of intended spying reached Pandathaway, the spies in question might be easily detected.</p>
<a id="p582" name="p582"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(582)">Which would be hard on the spies.</p>
<a id="p583" name="p583"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(583)">So Walter Slovotsky broadened his smile and spread his hands. "Just doing a little business, and checking up on Lou. I take it&#151;"</p>
<a id="p584" name="p584"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(584)">He was interrupted by the same rattling from the customs house. He furrowed his brow, finally noticing the wires strung on poles that led from the building and down the hill and into the valley. "Son of a&#151;"</p>
<a id="p585" name="p585"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(585)">"Telegraph." Ahira smiled. "He's got a telegraph." He looked over toward Slovotsky. "How's your Morse?"</p>
<a id="p586" name="p586"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(586)">Slovotsky shook his head. "I just barely was able to learn enough to pound my clumsy way to a beginner's license, and that's more than twenty years ago. You?"</p>
<a id="p587" name="p587"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(587)">"Not even that close." Ahira lifted his right hand, making it shake. "Remember? I couldn't make a dit different from a dah, much less get up to twenty words per minute."</p>
<a id="p588" name="p588"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(588)">"And a telegraph means electricity&#151;coal, you think? Lou used to say that he thought there was a seam of coal up in the hills."</p>
<a id="p589" name="p589"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(589)">"Could be, could be." Ahira nodded. "I think we'd better have words with the Engineer; he's been keeping secrets."</p>
<a id="p590" name="p590"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(590)">Jason cocked his head to one side. "Excuse me?"</p>
<a id="p591" name="p591"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(591)">"Secrets, secrets," Ahira said. "I thought Lou was going to tell us about any major advances, and this telegraph is&#151;"</p>
<a id="p592" name="p592"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(592)">"No, not that. You said that you couldn't learn Morse. It doesn't seem hard."</p>
<a id="p593" name="p593"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(593)">Ahira's face darkened; Walter stepped in. "You know how your Uncle Ahira used to be a human, on the Other Side?"</p>
<a id="p594" name="p594"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(594)">"Yes, yes," Jason said, tapping his foot impatiently.</p>
<a id="p595" name="p595"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(595)">"Well, as a human he had a dysfunction. It's called muscular dystrophy&#151;his muscles didn't work right."</p>
<a id="p596" name="p596"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(596)">"Oh," the boy said, clearly indifferent.</p>
<a id="p597" name="p597"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(597)">The idea of a permanent disease wasn't something he could identify with, Walter realized; any member of the upper class could afford the services of a good healer, and even a clumsy Spidersect cleric could help someone compensate for disobedient muscle and nerve better than could possibly be done by the most competent physician on the other side.</p>
<a id="p598" name="p598"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(598)">Some injuries, granted, were permanent, or close to it; Tennetty's eyes, the missing fingers on Karl's left hand, scars from where the body had healed itself imperfectly without benefit of healing draughts.</p>
<a id="p599" name="p599"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(599)">But muscles not working right? It was foreign to the boy's limited experience. Lucky kid.</p>
<a id="p600" name="p600"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(600)">Slovotsky walked over to the shack and leaned in. "Please tell the Engineer that Walter Slovotsky and Ahira are here, bringing a load of dwarven blades, raw silver, and fourteen hefty appetites."</p>
<a id="p601" name="p601"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(601)">The man inside began beating a rapid tattoo on the telegraph key.</p>
<a id="p602" name="p602"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(602)">Walter Slovotsky threw his arm around Jason's shoulder. "So tell me, what's this bullshit I hear about your dad going after the sword?"</p>
<a id="p603" name="p603"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(603)">"I haven't heard anything about it," Jason said, his face reflecting what appeared to be only honest puzzlement. "And I'd like to. Now."</p>
<a id="p604" name="p604"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(604)">You're taking on something of your father's imperiousness, Jason me boyo, and I don't like that much. Before you get to sing the blues, you gotta pay the dues.&#160;</p>
<a id="p605" name="p605"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(605)">"Make it a bit later, okay?" he said, trying to put just a trace of sternness in his voice. "We've had a long trip."</p>
<a id="p606" name="p606"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(606)">Jason visibly considered it for a moment, then nodded. "Agreed, Uncle Walter."</p>
<a id="p607" name="p607"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(607)">Slovotsky smiled. "Now, get on your horse. I want the ten-cent tour of Home&#151;by way of the bathhouse, and with special attention to the brewery. Seems there's been some changes of late."</p>
<a id="p608" name="p608"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(608)">"Brewery?" Ahira smiled. "Good idea. While you do that, I'm going to head for Lou&#151;is he in the cave?" he asked, raising his voice and turning to the guard in the customs house.</p>
<a id="p609" name="p609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(609)">"Yes, Ahira; I'll alert him that you're coming."</p>
<a id="p610" name="p610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(610)">"That won't be&#151;"</p>
<a id="p611" name="p611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(611)">"Easyway, warfday," Slovotsky said. "Ememberay ouyay aren'tway ayormay," he added in pig latin, knowing that it took most of a lifetime of English speaking to be able to follow deliberate fracturing of the language.</p>
<a id="p612" name="p612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(612)">Jason smiled and nodded his agreement, but the guard was puzzled. Which was just the way Slovotsky wanted it; no need to embarrass his friend in front of strangers.</p>
<a id="p613" name="p613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(613)">"Right," the dwarf said. "And please ask him to tap a keg; I haven't had Homemade beer for far too long."</p>
<a id="p614" name="p614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(614)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p615" name="p615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(615)">Taking another pull at his third tankard of beer, Ahira nodded in approval, both at the brew&#151;either his memory and taste buds were going, or it was a <i>lot </i>better than it had been back when Ahira was mayor&#151;and at the noisy machine Riccetti was patting the side of.</p>
<a id="p616" name="p616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(616)">The beer was awfully good, he decided. Not quite up to the level of Genesee Cream, but at least as good as St. Pauli Girl.</p>
<a id="p617" name="p617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(617)">The machine was impressive, too. "An honest-to-God boiler and generator&#151;Lou, you did good," Ahira said, shouting over the clangor of the machinery. The machine was hot and noisy, and Ahira really didn't understand the need for the odd-looking piston arrangement that had the huge generator humming, but it clearly worked.</p>
<a id="p618" name="p618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(618)">Riccetti smiled briefly. "Thank you," he shouted back. "It seems to do the job."</p>
<a id="p619" name="p619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(619)">Ahira looked the human over carefully as they stood near the warren holding boiler and generator, the heat from the machine beating against them like a wave, despite the cross-draft ventilation.</p>
<a id="p620" name="p620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(620)">The years hadn't been kind to Lou Riccetti; his unhealthy-looking skinniness had only gotten worse, and his head was now completely bald. His face and hands were splotched and scarred, and he walked with absolutely no spring in his step. The marriage to an ex-slave that Karl and Chak had arranged had been a profound failure; Danni had left with a trader several years ago.</p>
<a id="p621" name="p621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(621)">But there was an unself-conscious forcefulness in his manner, something that Ahira had never even seen traces of in the old days.</p>
<a id="p622" name="p622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(622)">"The phrase, Ahira," Riccetti shouted, "is 'happy as a pig in shit.' Which I am. Hang on a moment; I have to do a bit of business."</p>
<a id="p623" name="p623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(623)">He raised a hand and beckoned to the nearest of the engineers, a chunky man in his mid-twenties, who trotted over and bent his head near Riccetti's mouth.</p>
<a id="p624" name="p624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(624)">"Bast, you remember Ahira?"</p>
<a id="p625" name="p625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(625)">"Sure." The tall, broad-shouldered engineer stuck out a calloused hand; the grip was firm, for a human. "Good to see you again."</p>
<a id="p626" name="p626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(626)">"Have him buy you a drink later; we've got a lot of work for now," Riccetti said, dismissing the formalities. "Now, send the word out that the telegraph is going down for the night, and then hook up the DC generator around dark&#151;and have Daherrin post extra guards, all armed with signal rockets."</p>
<a id="p627" name="p627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(627)">"Trouble?" Bast asked, clearly perfunctorily.</p>
<a id="p628" name="p628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(628)">"No, but I'm getting skittish in my old age."</p>
<a id="p629" name="p629"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(629)">"Good." Bast nodded. "We going to run the hydroxy rig?"</p>
<a id="p630" name="p630"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(630)">"Right; I want a long run&#151;all through the night and into tomorrow. So break down the compressor, clean it, then put it back together&#151;and cofferdam around the bottles; I don't want anything else to break if they go this time."</p>
<a id="p631" name="p631"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(631)">"They shouldn't. I think the new valves will hold."</p>
<a id="p632" name="p632"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(632)">"We'll see."</p>
<a id="p633" name="p633"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(633)">"That we will." Bast nodded and walked off.</p>
<a id="p634" name="p634"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(634)">Riccetti beckoned to Ahira, and the two of them exited into another warren, the clatter of the generator fading in the distance.</p>
<a id="p635" name="p635"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(635)">"I take it you're suitably impressed?" At Ahira's nod, Riccetti went on: "A year or so ago, Karl asked me for some plans for a telegraph&#151;he wants to set one up over there&#151;and that led to all of this. I think we can give him a nice price on the whole package, now that we found that new seam of hematite."</p>
<a id="p636" name="p636"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(636)">The warrens were a bustle of activity; sights, sounds, and smells.</p>
<a id="p637" name="p637"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(637)">Riccetti guided him down a lefthand turn and into the residence section of the warrens, and past a guard into the Engineer's quarters. The room hadn't changed much, although Riccetti's sleeping area was now a real bed instead of a simple pallet.</p>
<a id="p638" name="p638"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(638)">Over in the corner, the telegraph rattled constantly.</p>
<a id="p639" name="p639"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(639)">Riccetti seemed to give it only a small portion of his attention; the news was probably not terribly important, Ahira decided, but he approved of the idea of keeping something going down the lines at all times. The mere fact of information traveling up and down the line was reassuring.</p>
<a id="p640" name="p640"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(640)">But there was something that the young engineer had said.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p641" name="p641"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(641)">"Hydroxy?" Ahira asked.</p>
<a id="p642" name="p642"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(642)">"Right&#151;just elementary electrolysis. Pour a direct current through a tub of water, collect up the bubbles with a nice blown-glass rig, and then run the gasses through a compressor&#151;"</p>
<a id="p643" name="p643"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(643)">"Electric motor?"</p>
<a id="p644" name="p644"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(644)">"Next year; right now, it's literally horsepowered. In any case, we squeeze the glass into brass bottles, and we've got bottled gasses."</p>
<a id="p645" name="p645"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(645)">"I could have guessed that."</p>
<a id="p646" name="p646"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(646)">"Eh?"</p>
<a id="p647" name="p647"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(647)">"If you put some gas in a bottle, it's bottled gas."</p>
<a id="p648" name="p648"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(648)">"All sorts of uses for that," Riccetti said. "You can get a very hot welding flame with hydrogen alone."</p>
<a id="p649" name="p649"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(649)">"I know; nice." Ahira nodded.</p>
<a id="p650" name="p650"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(650)">"Wait until next year&#151;if we've got the valve problem solved. We may have electric lights&#151;Aeia, of all people, pointed out how she could give night classes to farmers if we had decent lighting."</p>
<a id="p651" name="p651"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(651)">Aeia&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;Ahira smiled.</p>
<a id="p652" name="p652"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(652)">The first time he'd seen Aeia, she'd been a badly brutalized little girl who had been rescued by Karl, Walter, and Chak from a slaver; she was skinny, knobby-kneed, and homely.</p>
<a id="p653" name="p653"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(653)">The last time he'd seen her, she was lovely, almost ready to burst into her prime as a woman. He was willing to bet heavily that by now she was a treat for the eyes.</p>
<a id="p654" name="p654"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(654)">"How's she doing?"</p>
<a id="p655" name="p655"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(655)">"Good, but&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;I don't think we're going to have her around much longer." Riccetti shook his head. "It may not be long at all. Don't you believe that Bren Adahan is here just to help Valeran keep an eye on Jason. Or learn from me, despite his sincere smile. He's chasing her, and hard."</p>
<a id="p656" name="p656"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(656)">"You disapprove?"</p>
<a id="p657" name="p657"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(657)">"Not really." Riccetti sat silent for a moment before answering. "I just wonder about ulterior motives. Including my own; she's a hell of a schoolteacher."</p>
<a id="p658" name="p658"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(658)">"Good point." Being married to the emperor's daughter&#151;even an adopted daughter&#151;was hardly a bad political move for a conquered Holtish baron. Of course, marriage to Adahan would mean that Aeia would have to leave Home, and maybe Lou was just suspicious because he wasn't all that thrilled with that idea.</p>
<a id="p659" name="p659"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(659)">Ahira would have to talk to her. "And how are things political?"</p>
<a id="p660" name="p660"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(660)">"No problem." Riccetti shrugged. "I've been having Petros handle most of the local politics for me&#151;and as far as Khoral goes, all I have to do is delay wootz shipments whenever he makes annexation noises. Only trouble's been with the raiders."</p>
<a id="p661" name="p661"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(661)">Ahira didn't like the sound of that. "Bad?"</p>
<a id="p662" name="p662"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(662)">Riccetti shrugged. "More of too much of a good thing. With the way that we've cut into the guild in the vicinity, it's hard to find caravans&#151;some of the raiders are giving up on the life, taking up farming or mining." He shook his head. "Others drink too much. We had a murder earlier this year. Couple of Daven's men tried to extort some money out of a farmer, and killed him when he said no."</p>
<a id="p663" name="p663"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(663)">That sounded stupid; at Ahira's puzzled look, Riccetti shook his head. "No, I don't think they intended to; they were just trying to rough him up." He shrugged. "Didn't make much difference when they were dancing on the end of a rope." Riccetti took a long pull at his beer. "I can still see their faces, Ahira, still&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." He slapped himself on the knee. "But we've got to&#151;"</p>
<a id="p664" name="p664"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(664)">He cut himself off as the rattling of the telegraph took up a more insistent clamor. "That's my call; hang on a second." He walked over and tapped out a quick tattoo on the brass telegraph key.</p>
<a id="p665" name="p665"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(665)">At the clattering response, his face whitened. "<i>Shit. </i>Did you hear that?"</p>
<a id="p666" name="p666"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(666)">"I don't know Morse, Lou."</p>
<a id="p667" name="p667"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(667)">"Oh. Sorry." Riccetti shook his head. "We've got a messenger from Khoral. There's been a slaver raid in Therranj&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;numbers to follow&#151;I think that's Artyn, rushing the elf along&#151;three days ago. Major raid&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;they hit a baronial capitol hard, took treasure and slaves&#151;elves and humans. Khoral's soliciting our help. We can keep the treasure; he just wants the raiders punished and the elves freed."</p>
<a id="p668" name="p668"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(668)">Riccetti nodded to himself. "The old elf is learning. He can afford to lose a few pounds of gold to us more than to let them get away with a raid."</p>
<a id="p669" name="p669"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(669)">Ahira bounced nervously in his chair. "And what does he use for soldiers? Marshmallows?"</p>
<a id="p670" name="p670"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(670)">Riccetti shook his head. "Most of his troops are on the Melhrood border, not dispersed along the west. He is anticipating trouble with Melhrood; he wasn't looking for an attack from the west&#151;we've got a peace treaty with Therranj. You started the negotiations for it, remember?"</p>
<a id="p671" name="p671"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(671)">"Yeah, a treaty. Not a mutual assistance pact. Mmm&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;still, it is slavers and all.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p672" name="p672"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(672)">"Exactly." Riccetti looked at Ahira. "The only difficulty is, what with a lot of Daherrin's people up in the mines, we're deficient in manpower."</p>
<a id="p673" name="p673"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(673)">Ahira snorted. Riccetti was sounding more and more like a bureaucrat. "You mean you don't have enough warriors handy."</p>
<a id="p674" name="p674"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(674)">Riccetti glared at him. "It'll take at least a couple of days to bring them out and get them all organized; we'll have to send runners, since we haven't strung the telegraph wire that far."</p>
<a id="p675" name="p675"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(675)">Ahira walked over to a sideboard and uncorked a bottle of Riccetti's Best, tilting it back for a long swallow. The fiery liquor burned its way down his throat. "Okay. What can you do?"</p>
<a id="p676" name="p676"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(676)">"Maybe I could spare a hundred warriors, but a lot of them would be fairly inexperienced."</p>
<a id="p677" name="p677"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(677)">"Unblooded. That's not good."</p>
<a id="p678" name="p678"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(678)">Riccetti jerked his thumb toward the telegraph. "I don't know the size of the raiding party, but it's not going to be any smaller than a hundred. I just hope it isn't a lot larger."</p>
<a id="p679" name="p679"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(679)">He paused expectantly.</p>
<a id="p680" name="p680"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(680)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p681" name="p681"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(681)">Deep inside, the thought of violence still frightened Ahira as much as it always did, save for the times when his rare berserker rages washed such feelings away in a red flood.</p>
<a id="p682" name="p682"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(682)">But he just shrugged. "You could use an additional dozen or so? Thirteen blooded dwarves, plus Walter." If there was a better recon man than Walter Slovotsky, Ahira had never even heard legends of him.</p>
<a id="p683" name="p683"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(683)">Riccetti looked at him for a long moment. "I think so." He tapped a rapid message on the key, then turned back to Ahira. "I'm ordering horses, weapons, and supplies for a party of a hundred and twenty&#151;half of the scouts are to be diverted to finding the raiding party. And a war council. Petros, Bast, Daherrin, Daherrin's second, you, me, Slovotsky. Hmm&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;I'll add Valeran, Bren, Jason, Aeia&#151;"</p>
<a id="p684" name="p684"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(684)">"Why Jason? Why Aeia, for that matter?"</p>
<a id="p685" name="p685"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(685)">"She's got as good a head on her shoulders as anyone I know. And <i>he </i>is Karl's heir; he's got to find out how to do things like this."</p>
<a id="p686" name="p686"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(686)">"Then it's on?"</p>
<a id="p687" name="p687"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(687)">Riccetti shook his head and momentarily chewed on his lower lip. "All that's on is a war council." He tapped on the key again. "For the time being."</p>
<a id="p688" name="p688"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(688)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p689" name="p689"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(689)">Walter Slovotsky held his peace through most of the discussion. Everyone was talking about whether they should send a raiding party, and Walter wasn't interested in arguing over closed cases. It was clear from the start that Lou was going to dispatch a raiding party after the slavers, but was letting everyone burn out his concerns while the team's equipment was being loaded.</p>
<a id="p690" name="p690"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(690)">Slovotsky was impressed. Riccetti was getting clever; it was a trick Lou had probably picked up from Karl, and one Karl had picked up from Walter.</p>
<a id="p691" name="p691"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(691)">The counterraid was a necessity, both political and financial. For one thing, local raiding-team pickings had been too thin for too long&#151;Daherrin's team hadn't hit on a good slaver caravan for better than a year, and many of his men and dwarves had taken up mining or cropping to fill in. The thought of a nice slaver caravan, heavily laden with an elf baron's treasury, was irresistible.</p>
<a id="p692" name="p692"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(692)">It would have been nice if they'd had Ellegon to do a skyside recon, but the dragon wasn't due for several days, at a minimum.</p>
<a id="p693" name="p693"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(693)">Even that squared nicely with Karl's doctrine, which had always been to try to stage raids just before the dragon's arrival&#151;Ellegon's arrival as the air cavalry had saved more lives than Walter could count.</p>
<a id="p694" name="p694"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(694)">Still, some kind of recon was necessary. Walter had a hunch who was going to get to do one, once the slavers were located. That didn't bother him, just as it wouldn't have bothered Paderewski to play a few arpeggios on a piano.</p>
<a id="p695" name="p695"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(695)">There was one thing that did.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p696" name="p696"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(696)">"Lou&#151;is there any chance that this could be some sort of diversion, some sort of trick? Could the guild be trying to divert the Home Guard?"</p>
<a id="p697" name="p697"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(697)">"There's a theoretical possibility of almost everything." Riccetti considered it for a moment, then shook his head. "But it doesn't look that way."</p>
<a id="p698" name="p698"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(698)">Daherrin shook his head. "Doesn't matter. We got those cannons we been casting for Karl; there's about seventeen of them&#151;"</p>
<a id="p699" name="p699"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(699)">"Sixteen," one of the junior engineers corrected. "The new one cracked under test this morning."</p>
<a id="p700" name="p700"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(700)">"Sixteen usable cannons," Riccetti said, picking up the train of thought as Daherrin acknowledged the correction with a smile and a nod, "ready to set up on the ridge. With grapeshot, we could hold off a terribly large force. There's been no word of any army marching on us; I don't think this is a decoy."</p>
<a id="p701" name="p701"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(701)">"Okay, it's not likely to be a diversion for an attack on Home." Walter shook his head. "Is it possible that they're trying to draw out a raiding team? Get us to chase them into an ambush?"</p>
<a id="p702" name="p702"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(702)">Daherrin shook his head, a merciless smile on his face. "You're always too tricky, Walter Slovotsky. So what if it is? If they try an' ambush us, we jump them, kill them, free the slaves, take the money."</p>
<a id="p703" name="p703"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(703)">"I still don't like it." Walter wasn't crazy about the dwarf's clumsy English, either, but he didn't mention that. Slurred words and bad grammar wouldn't get him killed. A trap very well could.</p>
<a id="p704" name="p704"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(704)">"I think we should go." Valeran toyed with a wine goblet. "Assume&#151;"</p>
<a id="p705" name="p705"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(705)">"Excuse me, Valeran," Ahira said, "but I don't know why you think that you're going along. As I understand it, your job is to keep Jason intact, not go chasing after slavers."</p>
<a id="p706" name="p706"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(706)">Valeran looked at him coldly. "I think that is properly between me and my emperor. Or between me and the raiding-team leader."</p>
<a id="p707" name="p707"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(707)">"Ease up," Daherrin said, waving the matter away. "The boy'll be safe here; Valeran's in on the party if he wants it. You was saying, Val?"</p>
<a id="p708" name="p708"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(708)">"Valeran," the soldier corrected. "Suppose the slaver caravan <i>is </i>heading for a rendezvous with a much larger force&#151;what are they going to do, hope that we arrive to attack them at the same time their reinforcements arrive? Prevent us from properly scouting ahead? Make us blindfold ourselves during the fight?"</p>
<a id="p709" name="p709"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(709)">Bren Adahan chuckled at that last. Sitting next to Aeia, Adahan had kept silent, his attention only occasionally distracted by Aeia. Which impressed Slovotsky; the man had good concentration.</p>
<a id="p710" name="p710"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(710)"><i>As for me, little one, if you weren't Karl's adopted daughter, there'd be a bedtime story I'd be dying to tell you.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p711" name="p711"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(711)">There was a certain exoticness to her barely slanted eyes, high cheekbones, and creamy smooth complexion, and while Walter Slovotsky loved his wife&#151;Kirah was a swell girl&#151;he'd never made more than a pretense of faithfulness; that just wasn't the way he was built. Her preference for tight clothing, both her shorts and gray knitted pullover, emphasized the changes he'd seen in her.</p>
<a id="p712" name="p712"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(712)">Still&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;no, best to skip it.&#160;</p>
<a id="p713" name="p713"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(713)">Bedding Karl's future wife had once come a heartbeat away from getting Walter killed; he wasn't interested in finding out if trying the same trick with his adopted daughter would do the same.</p>
<a id="p714" name="p714"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(714)"><i>And maybe during a war council isn't the best time and place to figure out where and how and with whom I'm sleeping.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p715" name="p715"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(715)">Then again, there was no time like the present to open negotiations, even if he wasn't sure if he wanted to bring them to the obvious conclusion.</p>
<a id="p716" name="p716"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(716)">He reached over and patted her bare knee in what could have been an avuncular way. "What do you think, little one?"</p>
<a id="p717" name="p717"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(717)">She covered his hand with her smaller one, a grin creeping across her face as Bren Adahan's easy smile turned into a glare. "I think, Walter, that all of you are going to go anyway, so the best thing to do is to figure out how to do it, rather than wasting time on whether."</p>
<a id="p718" name="p718"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(718)">"Right." Impressive girl. Not only did she have remarkable legs and what appeared to be a set of nicely firm breasts&#151;but brains, too? Evidence of any skills of discretion would make Walter's decision easy. Of course, even then, she could ruin things by saying no. That happened to Walter, about one time in ten. His rare excursions away from Endell were usually successful in all respects.</p>
<a id="p719" name="p719"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(719)">"And a good point." Riccetti nodded and rose, speaking in rapid English. "Then I'm going to turn in; I've got a long night scheduled, and I don't see any reason to change things&#151;except to get the cannons emplaced and manned, just in case. Aeia, Petros, Jason&#151;you all have enough to do tomorrow without staying up for a planning session. Go to bed&#151;you can say your farewells in the morning."</p>
<a id="p720" name="p720"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(720)">Wordlessly, Aeia smiled a general good night, rose, and left.</p>
<a id="p721" name="p721"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(721)">"Petros, you'll guest with me at the New House; Jason will fix up another room for you&#151;it's far too cloudy tonight for you to ride home in the dark. Daherrin, you're planning on leading this yourself?"</p>
<a id="p722" name="p722"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(722)">The dwarf nodded, smiling broadly. "You betcha," he answered in English. "It's my kinda party, boss."</p>
<a id="p723" name="p723"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(723)">"Then leave me somebody good to act as chief master-at-arms while you're gone, and be sure we've posted extra guards. And watch yourself," he said, addressing them all. His brow furrowed, he turned to Jason, who was sitting quietly, listening intently. "Jason, I told you it was&#151;"</p>
<a id="p724" name="p724"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(724)">"No." The boy bit his lip. Walter looked closely at the boy.</p>
<a id="p725" name="p725"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(725)"><i>Uh-oh. </i>Walter Slovotsky had seen that particular grim expression before, although not on Jason's face.</p>
<a id="p726" name="p726"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(726)">It was the look of someone about to do something that scared him shitless. Walter Slovotsky would have seen the expression more often if he ever carried a mirror into combat.</p>
<a id="p727" name="p727"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(727)">He wasn't surprised when Jason shook his head and raised his voice, each word echoing with the loud slap of a quiet step through a minefield.</p>
<a id="p728" name="p728"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(728)">"I'm going along," the boy said.</p>
<a id="p729" name="p729"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(729)">&#160;</p>
