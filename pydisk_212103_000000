<h2 class="chapter">66</h2>

<p>You look like somebody ate your favorite puppy,&rdquo; Goblin
told me. Cracks like that could be heard all the time now that
there were no more dogs. There were just two sources of meat left.
The Nar exploited both. We restricted ourselves to stupid
crows.</p>

<p>I told Goblin and One-Eye what I had seen. Uncle Doj stood
behind me, quietly disgruntled because I wanted to see my own
people before I visited the Speaker. I was barely halfway through
it when One-Eye interrupted. &ldquo;You got to tell the whole
Company this one, Kid.&rdquo; For once he was as serious as a spear
through the gut.</p>

<p>And for once Goblin agreed with One-Eye without any big groan
and moan about the unfairness of it all. &ldquo;You need to get
this word out exactly the way you want it known to everybody.
There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of talk. You don&rsquo;t want
anybody building it up worse than it is when they pass it
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get them together, then. While I&rsquo;m waiting
I&rsquo;m going to skim those Jaicuri books. There may be something
else I need to tell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I join you?&rdquo; Uncle Doj asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Go tell the old man that I&rsquo;ll be there as soon
as I can. This is family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will.&rdquo; He said something to Thai Dei,
stalked away.</p>

<p>Bucket interrupted my reading. &ldquo;Got them together, Murgen.
All but Clete. He&rsquo;s off somewhere whoring and even his
brothers don&rsquo;t know where to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It something bad? You got that look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can get worse than it already is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to hear all about it in just a little
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five minutes I got up in front of sixty men and told my tale,
marvelling as I did that a band so frail and few could be so
feared. More, I marvelled that there were so many of us when,
hardly more than two years ago, there were just seven of us
pretending to be the Black Company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guys want to keep it down until I&rsquo;m
done?&rdquo; The news had them excited in a grim way. &ldquo;Listen
up. That is the word. They&rsquo;re making human sacrifices and
eating the corpses. But that ain&rsquo;t the whole story. Ever
since they joined us at Gea-Xle they&rsquo;ve been hinting and even
saying right out that us northern guys are heretics. That means
they think the whole Company used to do things their
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That started everybody talking and yelling.</p>

<p>I pounded a mason&rsquo;s hammer on a block of wood. &ldquo;Shut
up, you morons! It ain&rsquo;t the way the Company ever was. The
Nar never kept any Annals. They would know that if they had. But
they can&rsquo;t even read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not be absolutely sure that human sacrifice was never a
Company rite. We were missing several early volumes of the Annals
and I now suspected strongly that our earliest forebrethren did
follow a dark and hungry god with breath so foul and cruel that
even oral histories were enough to keep the native people
terrified.</p>

<p>Most of the guys did not care about the implications. They were
just angry because the Nar were going to make life harder for
them.</p>

<p>I told them, &ldquo;This is one more thing to make trouble
between us and them. I want you all to realize that we might have
to fight them before we get out of here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight I&rsquo;m bringing back some traditional business
that we have let slide since Croaker got to be Captain. We are
going to have regular readings from the Annals so you all know what
you have become part of. This first reading is from the Book of
Kette, this part probably set down by the Annalist Agrip when the
Company was in service to the Paingod of Cho&rsquo;n Delor.&rdquo;
Our forebrethren endured a long and bitter siege then, though there
had been a lot more of them to suffer. Additionally, I planned
readings from books Croaker recorded on the Plain of Fear, when the
Company lived underground for so long.</p>

<p>I dismissed the men to supper. &ldquo;One-Eye. No more groaning
when I announce a reading. All right? These guys didn&rsquo;t live
through that stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cho&rsquo;n Delor was way before my time, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you need to hear about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kid, I been hearing about it for two hundred years. Every
damned Annalist that ever was wallowed in the horrors of
Cho&rsquo;n Delor. I wish I could get my hands on those guys who
did the Book of Kette. You know Kette wasn&rsquo;t even the
Annalist? He was the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goblin. Grab Otto and Hagop. I want a little confab with
the oldest Old Crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We five put our heads together, conjured a little something for
the meanness. Once we had a scheme I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
what the Speaker thinks.&rdquo;</p>
