<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_43"></a><b>Chapter 32</b></h1>
<a id="p5226" name="p5226"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5226)">"I understand," Joshua remarked, "that the Baliu Trofts weren't exactly overwhelmed by our solution to the Qasaman problem."</p>
<a id="p5227" name="p5227"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5227)">Corwin shrugged, his eyes lingering on the starfield for another second before turning to face his brothers. The <i>Menssana </i>was due to load at any minute and he didn't want to miss seeing that. "They weren't at all sure it was going to work, if that's what you mean," he told Joshua. "We had to pull out disks and disks of data that showed how really uncooperative humans normally were and how any progress toward space would be dramatically slowed or even halted altogether once the mojos deserted them."</p>
<a id="p5228" name="p5228"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5228)">"If they do," Justin murmured, his own attention still directed out the window.</p>
<a id="p5229" name="p5229"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5229)">"There <i>is </i>that," Corwin admitted. "Actually, the Trofts were more convinced that would happen than we were&#151;it was the <i>results </i>of the change they weren't sure of. I get the feeling their biopredictor methods are a bit ahead of ours."</p>
<a id="p5230" name="p5230"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5230)">"Like everything else," Joshua agreed wryly. "Hey&#151;here come Almo and Aunt Gwen."</p>
<a id="p5231" name="p5231"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5231)">"<i>There </i>you are," Gwen said as they came up through the milling crowd to the others. "I thought you'd be watching from around the other corridor."</p>
<a id="p5232" name="p5232"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5232)">"You get a better view of the passengers here," Corwin explained. "I was starting to think you were going to miss the event entirely."</p>
<a id="p5233" name="p5233"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5233)">Pyre shook his head. "We just came from saying goodbye. Everyone else had been shooed out already, but they made an exception for us. Amazing what being a hero will do for you."</p>
<a id="p5234" name="p5234"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5234)">The others chuckled&#151;all except Justin, Corwin noted, who merely smiled slightly. Still, that was progress of a sort. The scars of his failings&#151;real or perceived&#151;were still visible, but at least they weren't bleeding any more. For his brother's sake alone Corwin could hope the Moreau Proposal succeeded.</p>
<a id="p5235" name="p5235"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5235)">"Jonny tells me you persuaded the Trofts to lend some troop carriers for the Caelian evacuation," Pyre continued. "How'd you sell them <i>that </i>one?"</p>
<a id="p5236" name="p5236"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5236)">Corwin shrugged. "Wasn't really hard. If the Qasamans <i>do </i>manage to get into space the Baliuies would just as soon they were as immediate a threat to us as to them. It's to their advantage to let us have the new worlds and help us a bit in settling them. Especially considering they've just saved themselves the cost of financing a war."</p>
<a id="p5237" name="p5237"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5237)">"There they go," Justin said suddenly.</p>
<a id="p5238" name="p5238"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5238)">Everyone turned to look. The line of passengers for the trip to Kubha&#151;or Esquiline, as it'd now been officially renamed&#151;were crossing the short distance from the old entrypoint building to the waiting ship. Near the front of the column Corwin spotted his parents, Chrys supporting Jonny with an arm around his waist but both walking with a firm tread. Bound for a new world.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p5239" name="p5239"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5239)">Behind him, Gwen sighed. "This really is crazy, you know," she said to no one in particular. "Emigrating in his condition&#151;and to an untested world, yet."</p>
<a id="p5240" name="p5240"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5240)">"Not <i>entirely </i>untested," Pyre reminded her. "Besides, the hot climate there will be better for him than anything the civilized areas of Aventine have to offer."</p>
<a id="p5241" name="p5241"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5241)">"And there're no politics there, either," Justin murmured.</p>
<a id="p5242" name="p5242"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5242)">Corwin looked at the other, wondering how much he knew of that old parental sore spot. But Justin's face was giving nothing away. <i>Doesn't really matter, </i>Corwin thought with a mental shrug. What mattered was that his parents would have their last two or three years together away from the worst of Aventine's memories. Away from Aventine&#151;and in precisely the same sort of culturally uncluttered world in which they'd first fallen in love. It was, Corwin thought, perhaps their best shot at happiness. He hoped it worked.</p>
<a id="p5243" name="p5243"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5243)">Together, the five of them watched Chrys and Jonny board the <i>Menssana. </i>Then Joshua let out a quiet breath and craned his neck to look down the hall. "I think we'll get a better view of the launch path from the gallery over there," he said, pointing. "Anyone want to come?"</p>
<a id="p5244" name="p5244"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5244)">"Sure," Gwen said. "Come on, Almo."</p>
<a id="p5245" name="p5245"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5245)">"I've seen enough lifting ships to last me both this life and the next," Pyre grumbled. But he nevertheless allowed her to steer him away.</p>
<a id="p5246" name="p5246"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5246)">Justin remained gazing out the window as the three left, and for a few heartbeats Corwin wondered if the other hadn't realized that he, too, had stayed behind. Then Justin stirred and glanced down the hallway. "You think they'll ever get together?" he asked.</p>
<a id="p5247" name="p5247"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5247)">"Who&#151;Almo and Aunt Gwen?" Corwin shrugged. "Don't know. I guess it depends on whether Almo ever allows himself to give up the responsibilities of being a Cobra long enough to accept someone else into his life. You know better than I do how seriously he takes his job."</p>
<a id="p5248" name="p5248"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5248)">"Yeah." Justin was silent a long moment. "You realize if it doesn't work&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;well, Dad will be dead before the Qasamans can find the new worlds, but Mom might not be."</p>
<a id="p5249" name="p5249"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5249)">Corwin understood. "I don't know, Justin. But if the mojos really <i>do </i>leave them there'll be nothing in particular to unite them into a common front, warlike or otherwise. Especially since they'll probably flounder around for a while just getting used to the new competition. And if they're broken up into smaller states or factions they're as likely to open trade as to take shots at us."</p>
<a id="p5250" name="p5250"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5250)">Justin shook his head. "You're forgetting what they're like. I've seen them, Corwin, and I know they'll hold the grudge they have against us until their sun burns out. That kind of hate and fear will keep them working together against us, no matter what other competition arises."</p>
<a id="p5251" name="p5251"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5251)">"Perhaps," Corwin nodded. "But only if their paranoia level stays as high as it is now."</p>
<a id="p5252" name="p5252"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5252)">"Why would it change&#151;?" Justin broke off as a look of disbelief crossed his face. "You mean&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;the <i>mojos </i>might have been behind that?"</p>
<a id="p5253" name="p5253"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5253)">"Why not? We know they can amplify human emotions when they want to."</p>
<a id="p5254" name="p5254"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5254)">"But what does it gain them to have their hunters jumping at shadows?"</p>
<a id="p5255" name="p5255"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5255)">"Well&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." Corwin's lips twitched in a secret smile. "If <i>you </i>were convinced the universe was out to get you, where would you rather live? A city on a plain, or a village in the middle of a forest?"</p>
<a id="p5256" name="p5256"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5256)">Justin opened his mouth, blinked&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and abruptly laughed. "I don't <i>believe </i>it."</p>
<a id="p5257" name="p5257"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5257)">"Well, maybe I'm wrong," Corwin shrugged. "But maybe in a couple of generations we'll find the Qasamans have become a perfectly reasonable society, ripe for trade and diplomacy."</p>
<a id="p5258" name="p5258"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5258)">"We can hope so, anyway." Justin sobered and turned again to the window. "It's so hard when the old folks leave the nest."</p>
<a id="p5259" name="p5259"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5259)">Corwin laid a hand on his brother's shoulder. "We'll all miss them," he said quietly. "But&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;well, they're old enough to make these decisions for themselves. Come on, let's get over to the others. Traumatic times like this are what families were made for." Together, they headed down the hallway.</p>
<a id="p5260" name="p5260"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5260)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p5261" name="p5261"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5261)">&#160;</p>
