<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Fifty-Five:<br>
OPENING ROUNDS</h2>

<p>I wakened startled. The null! I had been out of it so much it
disturbed me by its presence. I rolled out hurriedly, discovered I
was alone in the room. Not only there, but in the barracks,
practically. There were a few Guards in the mess hall.</p>

<p>The sun was not yet up.</p>

<p>The wind still howled around the building. There was a marked
chill in the air, though the fires were burning high. I shoveled
boiled oats in and wondered what I was missing.</p>

<p>The Lady entered as I finished. &ldquo;There you are. I thought
I&rsquo;d have to leave without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever her problems the night before, she was brisk and
confident and ready for business now.</p>

<p>The null faded while I got my coat. I dropped by my own room
momentarily. The Limper was there still. I left frowning
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Into the carpet. Full crew today. Every carpet was fully crewed
and armed. But I was more interested in the absence of snow between
town and the Barrowland., That howling wind had blown it away. We
went up as it became light enough to see. The Lady took the carpet
up till the Barrowland resembled a map taking shape as shadows
vaporized. She set us to cruising in a tight circle. The wind, I
noted, had faded.</p>

<p>The Great Barrow looked ready to collapse into the river.
&ldquo;One hundred hours,&rdquo; she said, as though divining my
thoughts. So we were reduced to counting hours. I looked around the
horizon. There. &ldquo;The comet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t
see it from the ground. But tonight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
it&rsquo;ll have to cloud up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Below, tiny figures scurried around one quarter of the cleared
area. The Lady unrolled a map similar to Bomanz&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Raven,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Today. If we&rsquo;re
lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re they doing down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surveying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than that was happening. The Guards were out in full battle
regalia, forming an arc around the Barrowland. Light siege machines
were being assembled. But some men were, indeed, surveying and
setting up rows of lances flying colored pennons. I did not ask
why. She would not explain.</p>

<p>A dozen windwhales hovered to the east, beyond the river. I had
thought them long departed. The sky there burned with dawn&rsquo;s
conflagration. &ldquo;First test,&rdquo; the Lady said. &ldquo;A
feeble monster.&rdquo; She frowned in concentration. Our carpet
began to glow.</p>

<p>A white horse and white rider came from the town. Darling.
Accompanied by Silent and the Lieutenant. Darling rode into an
aisle marked by pennons. She halted beside the last.</p>

<p>The earth erupted. Something that might have been first cousin
to Toadkiller Dog, and even more closely related to an octopus,
burst into the light. It raced over the Barrowland, toward the
river, away from the null.</p>

<p>Darling galloped toward town.</p>

<p>Wizards&rsquo; fury rained from the carpets. The monster was a
cinder in seconds. &ldquo;One,&rdquo; the Lady said. Below, men
began another aisle of pennons.</p>

<p>And so it went, slowly and deliberately, all the day long. Most
of the Dominator&rsquo;s creatures broke for the river. The few
that charged the other way encountered a barricade of missile fire
before succumbing to the Taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there time to eliminate them all?&rdquo; I asked as
the sun was setting. I had been itchy for hours, sitting in one
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than enough. But it won&rsquo;t stay this
easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I probed, but she would not expand upon what she had said.</p>

<p>It looked slick to me. Just pick them off and keep picking them
off, and go for the big guy when they were all gone. Tough he might
be, but what could he do enveloped in the null?</p>

<p>When I staggered into the barracks, to my room, I found the
Limper still at work. The Taken need less rest than we mortals, but
he had to be on the edge of collapse. What the hell was he
doing?</p>

<p>Then there was Bomanz. He had not appeared today. What was he
trying to slip up his sleeve?</p>

<p>I was eating a supper very much like breakfast when Silent
materialized. He settled opposite me, clutching a bowl of mush as
if it were an alms bowl. He looked pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was it for Darling?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>He signed, &ldquo;She almost enjoyed it. She took chances she
should not have. One of those things almost got to her. Otto was
hurt fending it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He need me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One-Eye managed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the night to bring Raven out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Again I had forgotten Raven. How could I
number myself among his friends when I seemed so indifferent to his
fate?</p>

<p>Silent followed me to where I was staying with One-Eye and
Goblin. Those two joined us shortly. They were subdued. They had
been assigned major roles in the recovery of our old friend.</p>

<p>I worried more about Silent. The shadow had passed over him. He
was fighting it. Would he be strong enough to win?</p>

<p>Part of him did not want Raven rescued.</p>

<p>Part of me did not, either.</p>

<p>A very tired Lady came to ask, &ldquo;Will you participate in
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just get in the way. Let me
know when it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me a hard look, then shrugged and went away.</p>

<p>Very late a feeble One-Eye wakened me. I bolted up.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We managed. I don&rsquo;t know how well. But he&rsquo;s
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rough.&rdquo; He crawled into his bedroll. Goblin was in
his already, snoring. Silent had come with them. He was against the
wall, wrapped in a borrowed blanket, cutting logs. By the time I
wakened fully One-Eye was sawing with the rest.</p>

<p>In Raven&rsquo;s room there was nothing to see but Raven snoring
and Case looking worried. The crowd had cleared out, leaving a ripe
stench behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seem all right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>Case shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. Let me look him over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pulse strong enough. Breathing a little fast for a sleeper, but
not disturbingly so. Pupils dilated. Muscles tense.
Sweaty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like much to worry about. Keep
feeding him broth. And get hold of me as soon as he&rsquo;s
talking. Don&rsquo;t let him get up. His muscles will be clay. He
might hurt himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Case nodded and nodded.</p>

<p>I returned to my bedroll, lay there a long time alternately
wondering about Raven and about the Limper. A lamp still burned in
my former quarters. The last of the old Taken still pursued his
monomaniacal quest.</p>

<p>Raven became the greater worry. He was going to demand an
accounting of our care for Darling. And I was in a mood to
challenge his right.</p>
