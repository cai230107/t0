<h2 class="chapter">7</h2>

<p>Bone tired, just as I had been every night for as long as I
could remember, I went to take my turn on the wall. I had no
ambition at all and even less energy. Seated in a crenel, I heaped
aspersions on the ancestors of all my bitty Shadowlander buddies. I
am afraid I lacked creativity but I made up for that with
virulence. They were up to something out there. You could hear
rattlings and mutterings and see torches moving around.</p>

<p>There were all the harbingers of a night without sleep.
Couldn&rsquo;t these people be normal and handle their business
during regular hours?</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t sound like they were more enthusiastic than me.
I caught the occasional sharp remark about me or my foredaddies,
like this mess was all my fault. I guess they were motivated mainly
by their sure knowledge that they would never go home if they
didn&rsquo;t recapture Stormgard.</p>

<p>Maybe nobody on either side would get out of this one alive.</p>

<p>A crow called, mocking us all. I didn&rsquo;t bother throwing a
rock at it.</p>

<p>It was misty out. A half-hearted drizzle came and went.
Lightning stalked beyond the hills to the south. It had been hot
and humid all day, then had turned viciously stormy toward evening.
Lakes of water stood in the streets. Stormshadow&rsquo;s engineers
had not made good drainage a high priority, despite the natural
advantages available.</p>

<p>It would not be a good night for attacking tall walls. And not
much easier for anyone defending them.</p>

<p>Still, I almost felt sorry for the little buggers down
below.</p>

<p>Candles and Red Rudy finished the long climb from the street,
groaning. Each carried a heavy leather sack. Candles grumbled,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old for this shit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it works out we&rsquo;ll all get to get
old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both men leaned on merlons while they caught their wind. Then
they dumped their sacks into the darkness. Somebody down there
swore in a Shadowlander dialect. &ldquo;Serves you right,
asshole,&rdquo; Rudy growled back. &ldquo;Go home. Let me
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of the Old Crew invested time hauling dirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Candles told me. &ldquo;I know. But what
good is alive if you&rsquo;re too damned tired to give a
shit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you read the Annals you know our brothers have said the same
thing since the beginning. I shrugged. I could come up with nothing
inspirational. Mostly you don&rsquo;t try to justify or motivate,
you just go on.</p>

<p>Candles grumbled, &ldquo;Goblin wants you. We&rsquo;ll cover you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In battered Shadowlander Rudy shouted downward, &ldquo;Yeah, I
know your turkey gobble. Fuck you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grunted. It was my watch but I could leave if I wanted. Mogaba
didn&rsquo;t even pretend to try to control the Old Crew anymore.
We did our part. We held our ground. We just would not conform to
his ideas of what the Black Company ought to be.</p>

<p>But there was going to be one hell of a showdown if the
Shadowmaster and his circus ever hit the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down Three.&rdquo; That he signed in finger speech. We
use deaf speech frequently if we talk business out in the open.
Bats and crows can&rsquo;t read it. Neither can any of
Mogaba&rsquo;s faction.</p>

<p>I grunted again. &ldquo;Be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I descended the steep, slippery stair, muscles aching,
anticipating the weight of the sack I would be carrying when I came
back.</p>

<p>What could Goblin want? Probably a decision on something
trivial. That runt and his monocular sidekick religiously avoid
taking on any responsibility.</p>

<p>I run the Old Crew, most of the time, because nobody else wants
to bother.</p>

<p>We have established ourselves in an area of tall brick tenements
close to the wall, southwest of the north gate, which is the only
gate still fully functional. From the first hour of the siege we
have been improving our position.</p>

<p>Mogaba thinks in terms of attack. He does not believe a war can
be won from behind stone walls. He wants to meet the Shadowlanders
on the wall, to throw them back, then to charge outside and stomp
them. He launches spoiling raids and nuisance attacks to keep them
wobbly. He won&rsquo;t prepare for the possibility that they might
get inside the city in significant numbers, although almost every
attack puts Shadowlanders on our side of the wall before we can
concentrate enough to push them back.</p>

<p>Someday, sometime, things won&rsquo;t go Mogaba&rsquo;s way.
Someday Shadowspinner&rsquo;s people are going to grab a gate.
Someday we are going to see full scale city war.</p>

<p>That is inevitable.</p>

<p>The Old Crew is ready, Mogaba. Are you?</p>

<p>We will become invisible, Your Arrogance. We have played this
game before. We read the Annals. We will be the ghosts who
kill.</p>

<p>We hope.</p>

<p>Shadows are the question. Shadows are the problem. What do they
know? What will they be able to find?</p>

<p>Those villains have not been called Shadowmasters just because
they love the darkness.</p>
