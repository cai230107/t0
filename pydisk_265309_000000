<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_15"></a><b>FIFTEEN</b></h1>
<a id="p1382" name="p1382"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1382)">I fully expected to find that the computer banks had also been damaged or destroyed, but that was not so. Either the fight had never reached this point, or no one had been interested in the records. I went to the control seat in the center of the room and studied the buttons on its board. The wall ahead was a vast visa-screen, meant to give visual as well as audible answers to questions. And built into the walls were the relays to carry not only the full history of the colony since First Ship landing, but also all data from the research labs. Most of that was classified, though, to be released only in codes I did not know.</p>
<a id="p1383" name="p1383"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1383)">Now I hesitated, not knowing just what combination would give us an account of what had happened in the last days. And for want of a better key word I decided upon "refugee," for it would seem this had all been triggered by the arrival of the first ship. Therefore, I set up that simple pattern.</p>
<a id="p1384" name="p1384"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1384)">"On the fourth day, sixth month, year 105 PL&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1385" name="p1385"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1385)">The voice of the recording rang startlingly loud through the chamber, and I hastened to cut the volume. The bare facts continued&#151;that the refugee ship had asked for landing, had been granted such to the north, and had planeted there. Then were added some facts concerning the new settlement.</p>
<a id="p1386" name="p1386"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1386)">From this the recording went on to the coming of the next ships, the appeal for the second landing, a meeting between representatives from the ships and the Committee&#151;plus the voting of the settlements. That brought us to the end of what we already knew. I leaned forward eagerly to hear what would follow.</p>
<a id="p1387" name="p1387"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1387)">"On Twelfth Day, seventh month, year 105 PL, it was decided in open meeting to ratify a second treaty, admitting the second ships, on the understanding there would be no more. This was voted in general meeting 1,200 to 600&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1388" name="p1388"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1388)">The voice was silent. It would seem that was the end of the refugee problem as far as the memory banks were concerned. There was one other place we could perhaps find out more&#151;Once more I punched a code and waited.</p>
<a id="p1389" name="p1389"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1389)">What came in answer was code, a series of numbers and allusions intelligible only to those who set it up. So it ran on and on, and I wondered what good those reports on experiments and sector progress would ever be now. Then&#151;</p>
<a id="p1390" name="p1390"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1390)">"Sector 4-5. Refugee party came early this morning. Wanted medical aid&#151;took Dr. Rehmers by force. Left men on guard behind&#151;killed Lofyens and Mattox&#151;looted the Rytox lab. Have most of our personnel now under guard. Warning: they took the old records&#151;" Once more the voice fell from that stark report into code. But I marked the numbers in my mind, signaling to Thad. He nodded, and I saw his lips move, so I knew he was also striving to memorize. The voice ended abruptly, and we heard the snick, snick of unfinished tape.</p>
<a id="p1391" name="p1391"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1391)">"6-c-r-t-tex-ruh-903," I repeated from memory.</p>
<a id="p1392" name="p1392"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1392)">"Yes," Thad agreed.</p>
<a id="p1393" name="p1393"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1393)">Now it remained to be seen&#151;or heard&#151;whether the information answering to that was also in code beyond our translating. I set up the call numbers and activated the banks.</p>
<a id="p1394" name="p1394"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1394)">"Classified, classified&#151;" chanted the voice. And on the board a red light flashed. I knew an alarm had gone to the quarters once occupied by the commandant. But there was no one to alert now, nor would any guard come pounding down the hall to investigate.</p>
<a id="p1395" name="p1395"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1395)">Having given its warning, though, the machine was ready to oblige with the rest filed under that heading. Most of it was formula that meant nothing to us, but finally it shifted into understandable speech.</p>
<a id="p1396" name="p1396"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1396)">"Highly volatile and unstabilized, not to be recommended. Results as follows. Plague possibilities: will kill within forty-eight hours. No symptoms except slight headache. Produces cerebral hemorrhage. Contagious as long as subject is living, but cannot be communicated except from living to living. Will destroy only intelligent life to the&#151;" Another rush of code, then: "Classified, fifth level, double code. We shall destroy all but master formula, which shall be coded in lock-files&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1397" name="p1397"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1397)">Again an end. Thad moved forward to stare down at the keys that had brought us that report.</p>
<a id="p1398" name="p1398"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1398)">"They must have found that formula. But why&#151;?"</p>
<a id="p1399" name="p1399"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1399)">"Lugard had fears of this." I told him what the veteran said concerning a pirate fleet using biological weapons known to researchers here. It seemed, though, that this weapon had gotten out of hand.</p>
<a id="p1400" name="p1400"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1400)">"Then they used it, and everyone just&#151;died&#151;" Even though he had seen the port and Kynvet, I do not think that before this moment Thad had really believed in the end of Beltane.</p>
<a id="p1401" name="p1401"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1401)">"We'll probably never know exactly what happened," I said. I was setting the code again for daily reports. There were two more, one from Haychax, the second from Kynvet, and that was broken off in mid-word, though neither had held any hint of danger.</p>
<a id="p1402" name="p1402"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1402)">"That's that." Perhaps sometime we could return here, experiment to break codes, or find a way to open fully the secrets of the memory banks. But we had no time for that now. I rose slowly from my seat, glancing from one wall to the other. There was a wealth of knowledge locked in here, but it was largely too specialized, with little to help us now. But there was something&#151;I had been here several times on errands, and I knew what I wanted and where it was stored.</p>
<a id="p1403" name="p1403"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1403)">I crossed the room to the far wall and punched a request pattern. There was a clicking of relays, and two rolls of Zexro tape fell into the open trough below. I picked them up and was about to leave when there came another and louder click.</p>
<a id="p1404" name="p1404"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1404)">"Sign, please. All requisitions for tape must be signed for."</p>
<a id="p1405" name="p1405"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1405)">I heard a choking sound from Thad, half laughter, half something else, which warned of his state of mind. But I turned and set my thumb into the sign block, repeating my name and the fact I was from Kynvet on official business.</p>
<a id="p1406" name="p1406"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1406)">"Stop it!" I caught the boy's shoulder and gave him a hard shake.</p>
<a id="p1407" name="p1407"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1407)">"Sign&#151;" he repeated. "Sign&#151;as if nothing's happened and you just came in for supplies!"</p>
<a id="p1408" name="p1408"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1408)">"Yes." It had struck me, too, that indifference to all but a patterned programming. A world might be dead or dying, but the machine demanded a signature to release two rolls of tape. To us, it brought home with a rush all the wastage and horror about us.</p>
<a id="p1409" name="p1409"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1409)">We turned and ran, out of that room of unfinished, or perhaps now, finished history, down the corridors beyond, out of that building, and into the field where the silent, dead ships stood pointing to the stars from which we were now perhaps forever exiled.</p>
<a id="p1410" name="p1410"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1410)">But once out in the open, some of the feeling that had set us fleeing the headquarters vanished. Under the unchanging sun, with fresh wind about us, we could be sure we were alive. Though our principal reason for coming to the port was a failure and hope of rescue was gone, there were others things here that could be of service to us. I decided to do some exploring for what we could eventually transport to Butte.</p>
<a id="p1411" name="p1411"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1411)">Also, if we could find a flitter in working order, we would be even more fortunate. It would have been easier to split up and do our searching alone with an appointed meeting place, but neither of us wanted that. To roam a town of the dead alone was at that moment beyond our courage.</p>
<a id="p1412" name="p1412"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1412)">However, what we needed could be only in a few places&#151;the park where all the in-use vehicles could be, the warehouse for off-world shipping (though that must be near empty), the machine shop where repairs were made on transports and machines still running, and the supply depot. I listed them, and Thad agreed. We needed more than what remained of this one day to search, and we decided to risk a stay in town overnight, camping out in the warehouse. Neither of us cared to enter a dwelling.</p>
<a id="p1413" name="p1413"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1413)">The vehicle park was a disappointment. Like that of Feeholme, the majority of the flitters and hoppers had been systematically destroyed. The one or two that had escaped were near the repair center and needed work. Given time and a chance with the instruction tapes, though, I thought we might put at least one into service again.</p>
<a id="p1414" name="p1414"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1414)">What bothered us most was the silence. Oh, the wind blew, and we heard the calls of birds (too many birds for a place where men lived), and now and then the sound of some four-footed scavenger. But this place made one look uneasily over one's shoulder and glance about sharply now and then. There was an odd feeling that someone had just left each room we entered or that someone had vanished around a corner only a second or so before we came into view. And that tension grew until Thad put it into words.</p>
<a id="p1415" name="p1415"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1415)">"They <i>are</i> here!" He made it a statement rather than a question.</p>
<a id="p1416" name="p1416"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1416)">"No&#151;at least we have seen nothing." But my feeling of being watched made me so modify that negative. Was it because we knew this was a place of the dead that we were so haunted by what we could not see?</p>
<a id="p1417" name="p1417"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1417)">After the park we searched the warehouse. I could dimly remember coming here with my father when I was small. Then it had been a busy place. Why, there had been four or five ships out on the pad at once, discharging cargo, taking on the exotic side results of lab experiments, while this building had been crammed with cargo.</p>
<a id="p1418" name="p1418"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1418)">Now it was largely empty. There were a few bales at the far end, and we walked toward those. It was dim in here. The lights must have shifted to "low" long ago. And even the soft pad-pad of our boots sounded too loud.</p>
<a id="p1419" name="p1419"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1419)">"Looters&#151;" Thad said abruptly.</p>
<a id="p1420" name="p1420"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1420)">He was right. The remnants of those off-world supplies had been looted. We saw broken boxes, torn bales, and again wanton destruction of what the raiders had not wanted. A careful search might reveal something worth carrying away, but since we had no transport save our legs, we were not going to add to our packs any except very exceptional finds.</p>
<a id="p1421" name="p1421"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1421)">"Supply depot&#151;" I took the next on my list.</p>
<a id="p1422" name="p1422"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1422)">"It'll just be another write-off," Thad replied. "Food is what we'll need most&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1423" name="p1423"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1423)">He was right. When I thought of it, breakfast was a long while back. We went into the office where the customs and the cargo masters had once dealt together and looked about. The room had two doors, one giving on the vast emptiness of the warehouse, the other on the outer street. I opened that to look out&#151;into silence. When I closed it again, I set the thumb lock. Why, I could not have told, save that with the door locked against the silence and the coming dark, I felt safer.</p>
<a id="p1424" name="p1424"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1424)">There was a small heating unit in the cupboard, probably intended for the brewing of caff. And a moment later Thad, peering into a drawer, found half a jar of that and an array of mugs. They must have been for official visitors, for on each was the insignia of one of the settlements.</p>
<a id="p1425" name="p1425"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1425)">I noted that when he picked out two, he did not take those with names on them we knew well, but rather set out a pair marked for over the mountains. I measured caff into the brewmaster and set it on the unit. Small tasks to keep the hands busy were good. When we sat down to wait the heating on either side of the desk, which served us for a table, we tried not to look at each other.</p>
<a id="p1426" name="p1426"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1426)">"What do we do now?" Thad broke the silence first.</p>
<a id="p1427" name="p1427"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1427)">"Go back to the Butte."</p>
<a id="p1428" name="p1428"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1428)">"You think that we&#151;we are alone here?"</p>
<a id="p1429" name="p1429"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1429)">"There may be someone left in the north, but I doubt it. They would have come into the port, too."</p>
<a id="p1430" name="p1430"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1430)">"And the refugees?"</p>
<a id="p1431" name="p1431"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1431)">"Would also be here&#151;with those ships&#151;if they still lived."</p>
<a id="p1432" name="p1432"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1432)">"I suppose so." He glanced over his shoulder to the door into the warehouse, which we had left a little ajar. "I can't help feeling that there <i>must</i> be someone, some place. And"&#151;his voice became more rapid&#151;"I don't want to meet&#151;whoever it is!" He picked up the mug of caff, sipping, but as if he still listened. And I knew what he meant.</p>
<a id="p1433" name="p1433"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1433)">We put our blankets on the floor&#151;hard beds, but they suited us that night, for in this office there was no hint of "ghosts." There might have been far softer rests in the port, but this night they were not for us.</p>
<a id="p1434" name="p1434"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1434)">Though we had seen nothing to make us think a guard was needed, we agreed to share sentry goes. Thad took the first, and I rolled into my blankets. We had turned off the light in the office, preferring the dark with the subdued light from the warehouse. I thought I would not sleep, but I did&#151;until I awoke to Thad's shaking. His other hand was over my mouth, impressing me with the need for silence.</p>
<a id="p1435" name="p1435"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1435)">As my sleep-dimmed wits cleared, I heard it. There was the rap of footsteps on the warehouse floor, and only one kind of boot made such a clatter&#151;a spacer's. One man&#151;no, I thought I could make out the sound of at least two.</p>
<a id="p1436" name="p1436"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1436)">Thad's mouth was close to my ear. I felt his breath on my cheek as he whispered, "They came in from the field. I heard a flitter set down there."</p>
<a id="p1437" name="p1437"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1437)">Together we crept to the door and peered into the warehouse. There was the glow of a beamer at the far end where the looted cargo was. And we could see two figures moving around there. So we were not alone&#151;</p>
<a id="p1438" name="p1438"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1438)">Once more Thad whispered, "Do you think they were watching us? That they know we are here?"</p>
<a id="p1439" name="p1439"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1439)">"No&#151;or they would have attacked," I answered. "They have the superior weapons; no need to worry about jumping us."</p>
<a id="p1440" name="p1440"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1440)">From what we could see, they were searching through the already tumbled containers, a kind of haste in their movements that suggested they were pressed for time or were frightened men.</p>
<a id="p1441" name="p1441"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1441)">If the virus was already seeded in them, then they were walking dead and must know it, having witnessed the fate of other victims. Also, they were more menace to us just living than if they hunted us with laser beams crackling through the air.</p>
<a id="p1442" name="p1442"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1442)">"Pack and out," I murmured to Thad. "Leave nothing to let them know we have been here."</p>
<a id="p1443" name="p1443"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1443)">We moved cautiously, assembling our packs. Thad collected the mugs and restored them to the drawer, while I snapped shut the door of the cupboard with the heating unit. We dared not turn on the light to check, but I thought that should anyone glance in, it would appear untouched. Then I loosed the lock on the outer door, and we slipped into the street.</p>
<a id="p1444" name="p1444"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1444)">It was just when I was sure we had made it safely that we heard a shout behind. We were a block away from the warehouse, needing to skirt the landing field to reach the open beyond the town.</p>
<a id="p1445" name="p1445"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1445)">"Lasers!" I warned Thad, and we jumped to cover in a deep doorway. The door gave inward, and we half fell into a hall. I had the door slammed again in an instant. They could burn in easily, but even the small portion of time needed for that would give us a fraction of head start.</p>
<a id="p1446" name="p1446"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1446)">Thad stumbled over something in the dark and nearly went down. He uttered a wild, gasping cry and shrank from what had tripped him, breaking past me down the hall. I dared flash on my belt torch for an instant, saw&#151;and followed him as precipitously.</p>
<a id="p1447" name="p1447"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1447)">The hall ended in a grav shaft, but I took the first room to my left, pulling Thad with me. I was rewarded for my choice by a large window. This was open to the night, and it took us only a second to drop through, landing in a garden, almost in a garden pond.</p>
<a id="p1448" name="p1448"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1448)">The space was walled with a lattice vine, so thickly entwined that nothing short of a laser beam could cut through it. But the strength of our fear and revulsion was such that, in spite of the cuts the thorns made, we went over it, hardly aware that we climbed until we dropped on the far side, once more in a street.</p>
<a id="p1449" name="p1449"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1449)">We still heard a distant shouting, sounding at intervals as if the shouters were not giving an alarm but calling questioningly. Did the hunters believe we were of their own band? And if so, why would we run&#151;unless all men had become very wary of each other since the plague hit.</p>
<a id="p1450" name="p1450"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1450)">For some moments I was confused as to which way we should head. To get away from the port and into the open country would, I was sure, give us the advantage. And I said as much to Thad.</p>
<a id="p1451" name="p1451"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1451)">"Where then&#151;back to the Butte?"</p>
<a id="p1452" name="p1452"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1452)">"No. We dare not let them trail us." Though we had tried to make the defenses as strong as possible there, I had seen too much here at the port to believe we could hold out if they brought their strongest weapons against us.</p>
<a id="p1453" name="p1453"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1453)">We ran down the street, using every pool of shadow to cover us. There was a flash of beamer, centering on Thad for an instant, before he threw himself flat and rolled.</p>
<a id="p1454" name="p1454"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1454)">"Hellloooo&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1455" name="p1455"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1455)">Not the searing rays we had expected, but rather a call. Were we wrong after all and those who chased us were not the enemy but our own people? But I was too certain of the click of space boots in the warehouse.</p>
<a id="p1456" name="p1456"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1456)">"Wait&#151;!" Again a hail instead of fire.</p>
<a id="p1457" name="p1457"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1457)">But wait we did not. I hauled Thad to his feet with a quick jerk, and we slipped between two buildings, striving to put the rows of structures between us and pursuit.</p>
<a id="p1458" name="p1458"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1458)">"Flitter&#151;" Thad gasped.</p>
<a id="p1459" name="p1459"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1459)">There was no mistaking the beating sound of a low-flying flitter. We ducked instinctively, hoping to melt so well into the shadows around us that we did not register for the pilot. It skimmed the roof near us and went down in the street we had just quitted, perhaps to pick up those on foot there or to join them.</p>
<a id="p1460" name="p1460"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1460)">"Come on!"</p>
<a id="p1461" name="p1461"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1461)">We used every trick we could think of, and enough of them worked to take us out of the port. A backward glance was startling. Lights had flashed on there. It was such a blaze as I could remember from my childhood&#151;a reckless burning of lately hoarded energy. They must believe us holed up somewhere in there.</p>
<a id="p1462" name="p1462"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1462)">"They didn't fire," Thad observed. "Why?"</p>
<a id="p1463" name="p1463"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1463)">"They could have enough of killing," I said bleakly. "Or else we were out of their reach before they discovered we were not their own kind."</p>
<a id="p1464" name="p1464"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1464)">"Could they have been ours?"</p>
<a id="p1465" name="p1465"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1465)">"Not wearing space boots&#151;and I heard space boots in the warehouse."</p>
<a id="p1466" name="p1466"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1466)">"What do we do now?"</p>
<a id="p1467" name="p1467"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1467)">"Circle north. If they try to trail us&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1468" name="p1468"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1468)">"How can they? If they are off-worlders, they have no tracking experience."</p>
<a id="p1469" name="p1469"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1469)">"They don't need any. All they need is an infra-scope. And those are to hand. That's why we stay as far from the Butte as possible as long as we know they are after us&#151;or even casting about in search."</p>
<a id="p1470" name="p1470"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1470)">Infra-scope&#151;another thing meant for a good purpose, which could now be used to put an end to us, unless we could get out of range. There were plenty of those at the port. The Rangers used them regularly for tracking animals. And they could easily be adjusted to human warmth broadcast&#151;since they had also located men lost in the Reserves.</p>
<a id="p1471" name="p1471"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1471)">So we headed north, in direct opposition to the path that had brought us to the port. I tried to think of some way we could baffle the scopes. Underground&#151;yes. We must keep away from the lava country, lest a pickup from the Butte betray what we wanted most to guard. But there were other caves in the hill country. Our supplies were low, and I had had no chance to replenish them from storage.</p>
<a id="p1472" name="p1472"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1472)">By dawn we were well out in the wild, but a flitter could run us down with ease. We needed rest, so we chose a thick copse and settled down. Thad slept first while I mounted guard.</p>
<a id="p1473" name="p1473"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1473)">It was cool under the low-hanging branches of the trees. I was sure that even hovering overhead a flitter could not sight us. But they would not need to actually see us. If the scope told them where we were, they need only train a laser in our general direction, and that was that.</p>
<a id="p1474" name="p1474"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1474)">I heard a flitter coming from the south. The woods were thick here, and if we separated for a short space, that might give them two targets, spoiling their aim. I shook Thad into wakefulness.</p>
<a id="p1475" name="p1475"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1475)">"What&#151;?"</p>
<a id="p1476" name="p1476"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1476)">"Move!" I shoved him a little to the right. "We go north&#151;but not quite together."</p>
<a id="p1477" name="p1477"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1477)">"Yes." He shouldered his pack, and we veered from one another. The flitter sounded as if it hovered just over us. I waited tensely for a burning lash to strike about me. Instead, I heard the booming voice of a throw-com, hollow and ghostly in the night.</p>
<a id="p1478" name="p1478"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1478)">"We know you are there. Come out! You have nothing to fear&#151;" The speech was in Basic, the off-world trade vernacular.</p>
<a id="p1479" name="p1479"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1479)">"Come out! We mean you no harm!" It blared away.</p>
<a id="p1480" name="p1480"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1480)">Did they think us so stupid? Why stop to talk? It was plain they had not wasted talk on the settlements.</p>
<a id="p1481" name="p1481"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1481)">Yet they did not fire, though by the sound the flitter still hung there. I could hear Thad moving through the brush, keeping pace with me but some distance away. Had our split-up, which seemed such a desperately futile precaution, really baffled our trackers? Or was there some reason why they were reluctant to loose death now?</p>
<a id="p1482" name="p1482"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1482)">We had seen their dead as well as ours. Could it be that they were reduced to as small a company as we were and that they now thought that those who had worked in the labs here might have some counter to the plague? My imagination supplied such an answer. I would probably never know whether or not it was the truth.</p>
<a id="p1483" name="p1483"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1483)">"We could cook you," the broadcast shrilled, "you know that, beam you right where you stand. But we haven't. Come out. We're all the same now&#151;we die, you die. Only you'll die the quicker unless you come out!"</p>
<a id="p1484" name="p1484"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1484)">Pleading and then threats, but manifest reluctance to carry those out. They wanted us in their hands, not dead, which meant they had a pressing use for us.</p>
<a id="p1485" name="p1485"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1485)">In the end, the land saved us by a route we could not have foreseen. This section must have been one of those once included in a small Reserve for study purposes. We came to where the tops of the trees met to veil a narrow ditch, a hidden observation walk.</p>
<a id="p1486" name="p1486"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1486)">I found it by tumbling in and seconds later heard Thad crash after me. That it was artificial was proven by its pavement. When I stood, the edges just topped my head. I whistled the call of a tree lizard and was answered by Thad who moved to join me.</p>
<a id="p1487" name="p1487"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1487)">We felt our way in the dark, buffeted and torn by briers, tough roots, all the impediments protruding from the sides of the cut, unable to use our torches. To my surprise I heard the flitter swing away, no longer hanging directly overhead, and I wondered why, unable to believe that its crew had simply given up the chase.</p>
<a id="p1488" name="p1488"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1488)">If they did not want us dead, they must be baffled as long as we stayed in thick cover. It might mean they were now seeking a place to set down from which they could move in on foot. If so, the advantage would be ours.</p>
<a id="p1489" name="p1489"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1489)">"I think they are setting down," Thad said.</p>
<a id="p1490" name="p1490"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1490)">If they were considering a landing, they had chosen wrongly for their purposes, for the sound moved far from us. We continued through the cut, which must end somewhere ahead.</p>
