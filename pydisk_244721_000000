   <em>Mordichai Black.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Jumping Jupiter, how could she be so unlucky?</p>
  <p>Mordichai&#8217;s reputation was well-known among Protectors. The man had an Outcast for a father (albeit one who might be making amends), and now he was busting his tail nailing traitorous Protectors.</p>
  <p>Her own tiny bit of treason flashed orange neon over her head. Every minute she kept silent was an Outcastable offense, and that little fact made her stomach hurt. Oh please oh please oh please ... don&#8217;t let him have seen her guilt.</p>
  <p>He couldn&#8217;t possibly have, of course. She&#8217;d kept her cool, though she probably <em>had</em> been a little more standoffish than necessary. Had he noticed <em>that</em>? Had he been suspicious?</p>
  <p>Izzy took a deep breath, trying to calm down as the elevator took her even deeper into the bowels of the U.N. basement. Unlike her recent trip to see Bilius, this time she hardly even noticed the elevator. For one, her office was down here, and the elevator ride&#8212;though always unpleasant&#8212;was somewhat familiar. For another, her mind was too full of Mordichai Black to have any room for her petty phobias, no matter how unpetty they might seem at some other time.</p>
  <p>The doors opened, and she stepped out, striding automatically down the hall toward her office. <em>Calm down, Izzy. Calm down and think</em>.</p>
  <p>Right. Good advice. She paused outside her office, took a couple of deep breaths, then pushed inside.</p>
  <p>Everything was as she&#8217;d left it. The five case files&#8212; including the one on Hieronymous&#8212;that had come with her promotion were stacked neatly on her desk. The black leather couch was cleared off, except for two small red throw pillows. An assortment of magazines and newspapers&#8212;everything from <em>People</em> to <em>Protector Living</em>&#8212;was fanned out on the coffee table. And her flamingo floor lamp burned in the corner, adding a soft glow and a bit of whimsy to the room.</p>
  <p>The familiarity of the room calmed her, and she tucked her purse into the credenza, then made her way behind her desk. She sat in the chair, leaned back, and contemplated her ceiling.</p>
  <p>She was fine. Mordi wasn&#8217;t going to present any problem. She&#8217;d picked up on his attraction, true. But she&#8217;d been so terrified that he might try and get close&#8212;and thus discover her misdeeds&#8212;that she&#8217;d immediately tried to discourage him.</p>
  <p>It had worked, too. No doubt about that.</p>
  <p>The thought brought a tiny tinge of regret. Under other circumstances, she might want to see what could develop between her and the likes of Mordichai Black. After all, with his tailored suits and prep-school manner, he certainly had the appearance of an eligible man. But it was those dangerous green eyes and the slightly wind tousled hair that shifted his appearance from refined to <em>very</em> fine. No doubt about it, in a different time and place, she would definitely look twice at the intrepid Mr. Black. Here and now, though? No. No way, no how.</p>
  <p>Which was why she&#8217;d put a quick damper on any heated thoughts that Mordi might have for her. Which meant that she&#8217;d see Mordichai Black at the committee meetings, but that was that. No planning strategies. No late-night coffee while they opined as to the state of mind of the various committee members. No scrambling to figure out how they could play a role in the negotiations bigger than simply being Halflings-on-parade.</p>
  <p>She told herself that was good. She didn&#8217;t want to see him. But even as she sternly lectured herself, a tiny rebellious part of her wanted to see the man again. Wanted to see heat flush that face, so perfect with its aristocratic nose and sharply defined jaw. Wanted to see those green eyes spark. Wanted&#8212;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Jumping Jupiter</em>! What was the matter with her? A good-looking man thinks a few lustful thoughts, and suddenly she&#8217;s ga-ga for him? She was made of sterner stuff, and she&#8217;d do well to remember just how much trouble Mordichai Black could cause her.</p>
  <p>With a frown, she glanced at the clock on her wall. Any minute now, Mordichai&#8217;s father would arrive ... and he was trouble enough without adding the son to the mix.</p>
  <p>And she <em>was</em> in trouble. The bump to Level V might technically be a promotion, but the assignment to Hieronymous&#8217;s case put her in a stress-filled, damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don&#8217;t position.</p>
  <p>So, yeah. She had a pay raise and she had a bit more prestige. Enjoy it while she could, because she was about to commit professional suicide.</p>
  <p>She sighed and glanced at the clock. Five after two. The Outcast was already late. Either that or he&#8217;d gotten held up on the security level.</p>
  <p>She sighed again, wondering if she should go check and, if need be, rescue him from the overzealous aides that guarded the Council headquarters&#8217; various ports of entry. As a re-assimilation candidate, he&#8217;d been granted immunity from his past crimes, meaning he could remain free in the world during the process. He could not, however, wander free in the Council hallways.</p>
  <p>As she thought more about her new candidate, she realized that she had to keep as much distance as possible if she wanted to extricate herself from this mess with her professional skin intact.</p>
  <p>It really was quite a conundrum. If she determined that Hieronymous was truly intent on reverting to good, many in the Protector world would shun her, forever looking at her as the idiot who reinstated the evil Hieronymous Black.</p>
  <p>But if she ultimately determined that he wasn&#8217;t sincere, then she either had to ruin her father&#8217;s life and shatter his dreams... or she had to keep her secret and risk being Outcast herself.</p>
  <p>Quite the pickle.</p>
  <p>Once again, she frowned and looked at her watch. Ten minutes late.</p>
  <p>Damn it all. Now that she&#8217;d got her head on straight, she really didn&#8217;t want to waste any more time.</p>
  <p>Grabbing her case file and security pass, she headed for her door, planning to make the trek back up the elevator to Security Check Point One.</p>
  <p>But as soon as she opened the door, she realized she didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
  <p>Hieronymous Black stood right there, an armed Protector in the familiar guard uniform standing at attention next to him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Outcast Black to see Counselor Frost.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes. Thank you.&#8221; Izzy lifted her chin and straightened her shoulders, sliding easily into her professional facade. <em>Maintaining</em> the facade wasn&#8217;t so easy, however. The famous Outcast was even more intimidating in person than his file photo had led her to believe. He had coal-black hair and the same sturdy jaw that she&#8217;d seen in his son. But while Hieronymous&#8217;s eyes were cold and superior, Mordi&#8217;s had been warm and willful.</p>
  <p>Hieronymous stepped past her into the room, exuding a masculine, almost metallic scent that she couldn&#8217;t place, but which seemed oddly familiar ... and definitely added to his overall charisma.</p>
  <p>Was it any wonder he&#8217;d turned countless Protectors, and that his reputation among Outcasts had grown on an almost daily basis?</p>
  <p>Realizing she was still standing in the open doorway, she gave the escort a quick nod, her signal that it was okay for him to leave, and then followed Hieronymous inside, shutting the door behind her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Alone at last,&#8221; Hieronymous said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221; she said, and to her infinite shame, her voice squeaked.</p>
  <p>He laughed, the tones almost musical, as he moved to sit on the couch.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes. Please, do sit down.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You doubt my sincerity,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221; She took one of the chairs opposite him, happy to be talking shop so soon. <em>That</em> she could handle. &#8220;I keep an open mind about all candidates.&#8221; Which was rather easy, frankly, when you could open their minds.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you <em>were</em> surprised to learn of my application,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, yes. I assume everyone was.&#8221; She almost said something about her own father, but then realized that he might not know who she was.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; He fixed his gaze on her. &#8220;Too bad they can&#8217;t all see into my heart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She swallowed. &#8220;Yes, too bad.&#8221; She, of course, <em>could</em> see into his heart. Not all re-assimilation counselors had that skill, and she was certain that her ability had played a big part in getting this promotion. Not to mention being assigned to Hieronymous. She didn&#8217;t, however, intend to read him right away, even though the re-assimilation process was one of the exceptions to the rule against mind reading. Instead, she liked to get a feel for the candidate first. Mind-exploring could be exhausting, and she found it much more tenable if she already had some familiarity with the candidate&#8217;s overall sensibilities.</p>
  <p>He seemed disappointed that she didn&#8217;t immediately reach out to touch him, but he covered it well. &#8220;Shall I tell you my story? Why I wish to come back to the fold?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That would be helpful,&#8221; she said.</p>
  <p>He nodded. &#8220;In that case, I&#8217;ll begin.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She focused on him as he spoke, letting her mind flow toward him, wanting to get a feel for the man himself before she took a closer look at his actual thoughts.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Sincere.</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;I suppose it was petty jealousy and youthful hubris that led me to spurn the Protector life in the first place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Truth.</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;After that, I discovered I had quite a knack for making money in the mortal markets.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Reluctant modesty.</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have a reputation for playing the markets and doing exceptionally well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He bowed his head modestly. &#8220;As I said, I seem to have a knack.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For inventing things, too.&#8221; She tightened the hold on her thoughts here, seeking to pick up any hint of his mind wandering-toward her father.</p>
  <p>Nothing. Just pride.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s also a gift.&#8221; His voice took on a sorrowful tone. &#8220;Though I suppose I abused that gift. I do so regret the harm and fear I&#8217;ve caused.&#8221; He paused, then looked at her with baleful eyes. &#8220;I think I was afraid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She blinked, trying to hide her surprise. &#8220;Afraid? Of what?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of mortals. Afraid that they would shun us, misunderstand us.&#8221; He sighed, the sound low and mournful. &#8220;I behaved like a scared child, acting out. And in the end, my own fears of mortals forced me off the Council and into a terrible Outcast existence.&#8221; He shook his head. &#8220;I can only hope that the Council can forgive me. And learn to trust me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She studied him, not at all sure what to believe. This was Hieronymous Black, after all. She&#8217;d grown up hearing the stories about how vile he was, about how he wanted nothing more than to destroy mortals and, if that meant destroying Protectors and the Council in the process, then so be it.</p>
  <p>That was the reputation, yes. But was it the reality? Her own powers were leading her to trust him; her initial impression was that he was ... well... <em>good</em>.</p>
  <p>Could he really have had such a change of heart?</p>
  <p>Could everything she&#8217;d heard about him have been exaggerated?</p>
  <p>More than anyone, she should know not to listen to gossip. She needed to judge a person on the evidence, not the rumors.</p>
  <p>But even so... this was <em>Hieronymous</em>. And rumors and gossip usually started as truth.</p>
  <p>Her face must have reflected her doubt, because he leaned forward. &#8220;I realize I&#8217;ve shocked many people, coming forward as I have.&#8221; He shook his head, as if pondering some unsolvable riddle. &#8220;You are my only ally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As my re-assimilation counselor, you are the only one who can ascertain the truth and let the Council know that I&#8217;m sincere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, he reached out to clasp her hand. She gasped, surprised by the unexpected touch. A million megawatts of thoughts coursed through her veins. Goose bumps rose on her skin, and a warm flush filled her body.</p>
  <p>She&#8217;d had no time to prepare, to try to control her abilities or rein them in. And without that time, his thoughts and emotions poured into her without direction or control, racing through her blood, filling her head. She couldn&#8217;t fight it, didn&#8217;t want to fight it. This was who she was, what she did. And so she let the thoughts and feelings run their course, and in the end, when she sat in the chair gasping, she could do nothing more than blink at him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did that on purpose,&#8221; she said, her blood pounding in her ears, as if she&#8217;d just run a hundred-mile marathon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I apologize. I was afraid that you wouldn&#8217;t. And you had to know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I would have explored your mind sooner or later. That&#8217;s my job.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He shrugged. &#8220;I wanted it sooner.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sincere,&#8221; she said, the word emerging as a startled gasp as the tremors of his emotion finally stilled inside her. &#8220;You really want to be re-assimilated. You really want to be on the Council.&#8221; She blinked, certain her face bore an expression of disbelief, but unable to erase it. &#8220;You really want to do <em>good</em>.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Hieronymous said. His black eyes bored into her own. &#8220;Why else would I be here with you?&#8221;</p>
