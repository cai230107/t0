<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_10"></a>The Case of Prince Charming</h1>
<h3 align="center">Robin Wayne Bailey</h3>
<div align="center"><i>Her fierce gaze lent the sun its blaze</i><i>As she rode out of the west</i><i>With a heart full of pride, and a sword by her side</i><i>And chain mail on her breast.</i><i>She didn't complain of the chafing pain;</i><i>She never let out a whimper;</i><i>She didn't flinch, nor give an inch,</i><i>But that gal was quick to temper!</i><i>Now since days of old her story's been told</i><i>In poesy, fiction, and song</i><i>By children dear both far and near&#151;</i><i>Yet everyone got it wrong!</i></div>
<a id="p1533" name="p1533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1533)" >&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1534" name="p1534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1534)" >Name's Rose. Bad Rose in some villages. I move around a lot; that's best in my line of work. Get in, get out, solve the problem, do the job, move on. This wasn't always my life, but it beats swabbing floors in some dark forest shack for a bunch of leering dwarves, and with every monk and nun from here to Shrewsbury making names for themselves at this game, I figured I'd try it. I'm good at poking my nose in, asking questions.</p>
<a id="p1535" name="p1535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1535)" >&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1536" name="p1536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1536)" >I'd gone a while between hires. My purse was flatter than a wedding singer when I passed through the woodlands of Sardeenia. Without warning, six horsemen emerged from the trees, armed and armored identically. Red tabards with gold baldrics covered the steel plate under which they sweated and stank. On each baldric was emblazoned a small gray fish.</p>
<a id="p1537" name="p1537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1537)" >Bringing Asta, my piebald mount, to a halt, I put a hand to the hilt of my sword and straightened in the saddle. "Fashion statement?" I asked, sneering. A good sneer can hide a lot of uncertainty; I practice mine. "Or are you just really fond of each other?"</p>
<a id="p1538" name="p1538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1538)" >A seventh figure rode up beside the others. A little skunk of a man in black robes with white ruffles at collar and cuffs. A seal of office on a red ribbon hung around his squat neck. I guess it was supposed to impress someone.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1539" name="p1539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1539)" >He sniffed a pinch of snuff. "Your own armor&#151;" he said with a sneer as practiced as my own, "&#151;what there is of it. A fashion statement, too? That <i>barbarian princess</i> look is so stale."</p>
<a id="p1540" name="p1540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1540)" >"It's practical," I answered. "It's cool in this heat." I sat up straighter and adjusted the leather strap over my right sun-reddened shoulder. "And when I walk into a fight, my opponent ogles my chest for three or four seconds before he notices my sword. By that time, I'm wearing his testicles for earrings."</p>
<a id="p1541" name="p1541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1541)" >He had a voice like a barrel of oil and a manner twice as slick. "I see I've found the right woman." He made a bow from his saddle. "I am Lord Parfum, advisor to His Majesty Leonardo, who, hearing a rumor that you were traveling through Sardeenia, sent me to find you, Rose."</p>
<a id="p1542" name="p1542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1542)" >Leonardo. The Lion-King, himself. "He has a job for me? A thief to catch? A murder to solve? Some mystery beyond the talents of his constables?"</p>
<a id="p1543" name="p1543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1543)" >Parfum demurred. "He has dinner."</p>
<a id="p1544" name="p1544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1544)" >My stomach growled.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1545" name="p1545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1545)" >That was five days ago.</p>
<a id="p1546" name="p1546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1546)" >I fingered the purse on my belt, which jingled half full of fish-shaped gold sardeenmars. Leonardo had a job for me, all right, but I'd earned these coins the hard way. Two days and nights of feasting, and his hands had been busier under the table than the palace mice. My thighs were bruised and mottled from his insistant pawing.</p>
<a id="p1547" name="p1547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1547)" >His gold was good, though, and it wasn't as if I hadn't fended off such advances before. Especially from employers.</p>
<a id="p1548" name="p1548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1548)" >Asta shifted restlessly. I steadied him with a pat on the withers. From the edge of the woods, I observed the gates of an ancient castle. Its walls were burned blacker than a new bride's biscuits, yet they stood stout and formidable.</p>
<a id="p1549" name="p1549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1549)" >Quiet, too. The old stones kept their secrets. Nothing moved on the parapets, no sentries, no pennants stirring in the breeze, not even birds.</p>
<a id="p1550" name="p1550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1550)" >On the bank of the moat, charred ribcages stuck up like driftwood, a legbone here, a skull there. Scattered among those, a few rusted tools&#151;rakes and hoes mostly&#151;stark testimony to the evil of the queen who dwelled inside.</p>
<a id="p1551" name="p1551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1551)" >If she had a name, no one used it. Leonardo, whose sister-in-law she was, called her the "Evil Queen," or sometimes the "Old Witch," though his voice dropped when he spoke of her, and he tended to look over his shoulder a lot.</p>
<a id="p1552" name="p1552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1552)" > I brushed a hand through a shock of tangled black hair that had strayed over my shoulder. I wanted a bath, but I guided Asta in a slow circle around the castle, careful to keep out of sight beneath the surrounding trees.</p>
<a id="p1553" name="p1553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1553)" >I disliked kidnapping cases; I disliked magic even more. Sorcerers, wizards, witches&#151;all river rats as far as I was concerned, best left to the night. But Leonardo had paid me well and promised more, enough for an office and a secretary if I ever chose to settle somewhere. I liked the idea of a secretary; some masculine piece of candy to lounge across my desk, who'd taunt me with his efficiencies on slow, hot days. Someone to take a little shorthand, or even a little longhand.</p>
<a id="p1554" name="p1554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1554)" >A low branch slapped me across the face. I dismissed my fantasies and brought my mind back to business.</p>
<a id="p1555" name="p1555"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1555)" >The Old Witch&#151;all right, Leonardo hadn't really said "witch"&#151;had poisoned his brother Clarence and seized control of neighboring Anchovia, crushing all opposition with her black arts. "But I have a nephew," Leonardo had continued as he squeezed my thigh. "Clarence's son, the rightful sovereign of Anchovia. He hasn't been seen since Clarence's murder."</p>
<a id="p1556" name="p1556"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1556)" >I'd lifted his hand from my leg and pressed it firmly into a bowl of mashed potatoes. Lord Parfum had sniggered, then quickly raised his napkin to hide his grin. An uncomfortable silence had filled the dining hall as Leonardo stiffly wiped his hand on the tablecloth's hem. When he leaned close again, I had the creepy feeling he had enjoyed that.</p>
<a id="p1557" name="p1557"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1557)" >He'd resumed the conversation as if nothing had happened, describing his nephew: nineteen, fair of face, blue eyes, hair black as his mother's heart. Leonardo had winked then. "And a manner that can charm the skin off a snake. He's known as Prince Charming."</p>
<a id="p1558" name="p1558"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1558)" >From the far side of the table, Lord Parfum had murmured, "The prince takes after his uncle." He'd smiled slyly, showing perfect teeth like the boards in a white picket fence. "If you could bottle and sell whatever that boy's got, you'd make a fortune."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1559" name="p1559"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1559)" >I could learn nothing more from the outside of the castle. I turned Asta and followed a narrow stream to the village a half mile away. It wasn't much of a village. It lay nestled in a valley among the wooded hills, nearly abandoned now. The cottages on the outskirts were aged and deteriorated. Shops and businesses were ill-kempt or empty. Mud and filth had long buried the paving stones of Main Street.</p>
<a id="p1560" name="p1560"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1560)" >I remembered those charred bones outside the castle walls. Perhaps the populace had decided living next to a wicked witch wasn't such a great idea.</p>
<a id="p1561" name="p1561"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1561)" >The inn looked a little better. A sign hung on rusty chains above its door, and a pale stick figure over faded black letters proclaimed the inn's name: THE THIN MAN. I draped Asta's reins over a post and tugged my saddlebags from behind the saddle.</p>
<a id="p1562" name="p1562"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1562)" >An old woman, her face as rough and rutted as the street outside, glared at me over a bucket of water and a mop as I entered. She eyeballed my armor and sword, then resumed her work. "Ye looks like trouble," she grumbled. "I don't needs no trouble in my place."</p>
<a id="p1563" name="p1563"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1563)" >"Trouble is my business," I answered. Moving carefully around the wet edge of her floor, I lay a gold sardeenmar on a counter. "I need a room, a bite to eat, and some wine if you have it. A bath, too."</p>
<a id="p1564" name="p1564"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1564)" >She leaned on her mop and licked her lips as she looked at the small, gleaming fish. Her tongue painted a smile where a frown had been. "Well now, milady," she said with newfound cheerfulness, "yer business don't be any business o' mine. An' I gots a fine room with a sunset view freshly made up."</p>
<a id="p1565" name="p1565"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1565)" >I held up a second coin. "Can someone stable my horse?"</p>
<a id="p1566" name="p1566"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1566)" >She snatched the sardeenmar from my fingers and swept up the other in the same motion. "Done an' done," she answered. "We gots a stable out back, an' feed's no extra charge." She winked. An ornery glint sparkled in her eye. "I can even digs out a spare sweater for ye. Come evening ye might gets a bit chilly in that outfit."</p>
<a id="p1567" name="p1567"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1567)" >It had been a long day. I was tired from the saddle and itchy with scratches from brush and tree limbs. My manners and my patience melted. "Most men think the less I wear the hotter I am. Not that you'd understand that."</p>
<a id="p1568" name="p1568"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1568)" >She barked a laugh. "Now I know how ye makes so much money." She parked the mop in the bucket of water and beckoned as she led the way across the room and down a corridor. "All yer tartin' won't earn ye much here, milady. We don't gots but one real man in this town, an' he be locked up in the castle."</p>
<a id="p1569" name="p1569"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1569)" >That caught my attention. "Prince Charming?"</p>
<a id="p1570" name="p1570"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1570)" >She glowered over her shoulder, a look that on a younger woman I might have construed as jealousy. "Aye, every woman what's left in this dunghill town pines for that beautiful boy," she admitted, "an' all their husbands be sulkin'." She pushed open a door. "I'll fetch ye a bite to eat now. The bath'll be a basin bowl an' a pitcher o' water. I'd heat it up for ye, but seein' as how ye're so hot already . . ."</p>
<a id="p1571" name="p1571"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1571)" >I sighed and offered another goldfish as I entered the room.</p>
<a id="p1572" name="p1572"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1572)" >" . . . Seein' as how ye're so generous with yer riches," she corrected, "I'll heat it nice an' hot." She backed out with a mocking bow, closing the door, muttering as she went, "An' if'n ye scald yer pretty pink opportunities it's no fault o' mine!"</p>
<a id="p1573" name="p1573"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1573)" >The room, as promised, was meticulously clean. A polished little oak chair stood by the door. Dropping my saddlebags, I sat and wearily began pulling off my boots. For a moment, the place reminded me of the domestic life I'd left behind. The floor gleamed in sunlight that came through the open-shuttered window. A dainty oak table and another chair occupied the center of the room. On the table, a vase of fresh flowers rested on a crocheted doily.</p>
<a id="p1574" name="p1574"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1574)" >The bed made me gasp. It was piled with feather mattresses, pillows, and covered with elaborate piece-quilts.</p>
<a id="p1575" name="p1575"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1575)" > I fumbled with my belt, let sword and purse fall to the floor, armor next. Forgetting all else, I stretched naked on that plushness. With no intention to sleep, I closed my eyes. For an instant, I heard singing saucers and dancing teacups&#151;a strangely recurrent nightmare&#151;then even that melted away.</p>
<a id="p1576" name="p1576"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1576)" >"Let me die in such a bed!" I breathed.</p>
<a id="p1577" name="p1577"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1577)" >"I can arrange that."</p>
<a id="p1578" name="p1578"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1578)" >A gloved hand settled over my mouth. I opened my eyes. The bare edge of a dagger teased my breast. My uninvited visitor added, "But it would be such a waste."</p>
<a id="p1579" name="p1579"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1579)" >I lay still, irritatingly aware of my sword belt out of reach on the floor and the open window through which my guest had come. His eyes gazed into mine as he slid the dagger over my belly.</p>
<a id="p1580" name="p1580"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1580)" >"Bad Rose," he murmured. "You don't look so bad to me. Not bad at all."</p>
<a id="p1581" name="p1581"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1581)" >A grin spread over his weather-beaten face. As faces went, it wasn't unpleasant; the smattering of dark whiskers and the broad mustache gave it character. A falconer, I assumed, for on the shoulder of his laced jerkin, a black bird was embroidered, and I recognized it&#151;a Maltese falcon.</p>
<a id="p1582" name="p1582"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1582)" >I made myself as provocatively comfortable as I could under his dagger point. Maybe I could lull him into carelessness. "Such a big blade," I purred, "must take a tight sheath."</p>
<a id="p1583" name="p1583"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1583)" >A clatter sounded at the door; an ancient foot kicked it open. The falconer shot a look over his shoulder. With a folded towel on one arm and a pan of steaming water between her hands, the landlady entered. She stopped; a look spread over her face that might have heated the water another ten degrees.</p>
<a id="p1584" name="p1584"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1584)" >The startled falconer leaped from the bed. Taking advantage of his inattention, I planted a foot on his conveniently turned, not to mention well-shaped, rump and shoved.</p>
<a id="p1585" name="p1585"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1585)" >"Rape!" screamed the landlady. She threw the pan's scalding contents.</p>
<a id="p1586" name="p1586"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1586)" >The falconer's scream rivaled hers for shrillness. He clutched his face, then his clothes as the water penetrated to his skin. He danced around in pain. The landlady had at him with the empty pan, beating him about the head and shoulders, while crouched at the foot of the bed, I watched in amusement until he batted her aside with an enraged gesture.</p>
<a id="p1587" name="p1587"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1587)" >Half-blinded, he lurched toward the window, overturning a chair, stumbling against the table.</p>
<a id="p1588" name="p1588"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1588)" >I dived for his legs, wrapping my arms around handsomely muscled calves. Even in the midst of combat such things should be appreciated; there had to be a reason to call it <i>close combat</i>. He fell with a crash. I snatched up his dagger, grabbed a handful of his nicely textured black hair, and jerked his head back.</p>
<a id="p1589" name="p1589"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1589)" >At the touch of steel against his throat, his groans stopped. I sat on his spine, his arms pinned under my knees, suddenly enjoying myself. "Now this is my idea of a provocative posture!"</p>
<a id="p1590" name="p1590"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1590)" >"Rutters!" screamed the landlady. She ran at me, her face contorted, the pan raised high.</p>
<a id="p1591" name="p1591"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1591)" >Before she could strike, I turned the blade toward her. She stopped in mid-charge. "Don't make me kick your saggy baggy butt out of here, old mother," I warned.</p>
<a id="p1592" name="p1592"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1592)" >She lowered the pan; her shoulders drooped; she turned and slunk toward the door. "I never gets to play," she grumbled. "Why don't they ever invites me to play in their sick games?"</p>
<a id="p1593" name="p1593"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1593)" >"Don't forget my dinner!" I called after her. 	</p>
<a id="p1594" name="p1594"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1594)" >The falconer shifted uncomfortably, his garments still steaming. I rapped his head with the flat of the dagger, and he grew still once more. "Isn't this nice?" I chirped pleasantly.</p>
<a id="p1595" name="p1595"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1595)" > He gave a low groan. "Nice," he agreed uncertainly. "Are you going to cut my throat or not? If not, let go of the hair, please. I couldn't attract a nice piece like you with a bald spot."</p>
<a id="p1596" name="p1596"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1596)" >"Sassy," I purred. Moving the dagger point to the back of his neck, I let go of his hair and reached between his legs. He gave a shiver and groaned an entirely new note.</p>
<a id="p1597" name="p1597"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1597)" >"On the other hand, I hear some women like bald men," he hissed through clenched teeth.</p>
<a id="p1598" name="p1598"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1598)" >I gave him a couple of gentle squeezes. He twitched and squirmed as much as he dared. "Not that I object to company," I said conversationally, "but I usually prefer to dress for my guests. What must you think of me?"</p>
<a id="p1599" name="p1599"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1599)" >His voice turned husky. "My opinion is going up by the minute." And to my surprise, I noticed, so it was. I let go of the grip I had between his legs and slapped his rump sharply.</p>
<a id="p1600" name="p1600"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1600)" >"Yes!" he moaned. He raised his head from the floor; his eyes were closed. "Spank me!"</p>
<a id="p1601" name="p1601"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1601)" >I drove my fist between his shoulder blades. "What kind of girl do you think I am?"</p>
<a id="p1602" name="p1602"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1602)" >"Punish me!" he begged. "I've been bad!"</p>
<a id="p1603" name="p1603"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1603)" >I'd heard of men who craved abuse. Living with a bunch of dwarves in the woods, I'd heard of just about everything. And who was I to judge? Ripping free his jerkin's leather lacing, I draped it over his neck like a horse's reins and bounced jauntily on his back.</p>
<a id="p1604" name="p1604"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1604)" >It was time to get down to serious business, though. I dealt his rump a sharp slap. "You didn't just happen by my window," I said, slapping him harder. "You knew my name&#151;who sent you?"</p>
<a id="p1605" name="p1605"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1605)" >"You can't make me tell!" he challenged. I knew he wanted to prolong the fun.</p>
<a id="p1606" name="p1606"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1606)" >He arched his back, an invitation, and I grabbed him between the legs again. The landlady surely heard the sound he made. "No, no!" He shook his head furiously. One arm slipped from beneath my pinning knee, but he made no effort to throw me off.</p>
<a id="p1607" name="p1607"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1607)" >"Who?" I shouted. I jerked on the lacing. The landlady must have heard me, too. In fact, by the shuffling and the shadow at the bottom of my door, the nosy crone was in the hallway listening. "Give it to me," I ordered. "Give me what I want!"</p>
<a id="p1608" name="p1608"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1608)" >I lashed him with the thin leather, snapping it on cheeks and shoulders. My thighs squeezed his ribs. His feet drummed the floor; his vertebrae popped noisily, I rode him so hard. "No!" he cried. "You'll never make me betray my queen!"</p>
<a id="p1609" name="p1609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1609)" >I frowned. I stood up.</p>
<a id="p1610" name="p1610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1610)" >He rolled onto his back, disappointment flooding his eyes. "What's wrong?"</p>
<a id="p1611" name="p1611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1611)" >Careful not to slip on the wet floor, I righted the overturned chair, centered the flower vase, and lay the dagger on the table. "I don't like easy men," I answered without looking at him. A breeze from the the window reminded me I was naked. I pulled the sheet from the bed, wrapped it around myself, then picked up my sheathed sword.</p>
<a id="p1612" name="p1612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1612)" >When I turned around, the disheveled falconer stood holding the dagger limply in his hand. The lacing dangled from his neck. "Maybe I lied," he said half-heartedly. "Maybe I have more information."</p>
<a id="p1613" name="p1613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1613)" >I shook my head. "Just leave the way you came." With the tip of the sword's sheath I nudged him toward the window.</p>
<a id="p1614" name="p1614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1614)" >He backed up reluctantly. "She saw you spying on the castle," he said as he sheathed his smaller weapon and tried to straighten his clothes. "You'll never get in. The place is impregnable."</p>
<a id="p1615" name="p1615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1615)" >"Tell her I'm coming to see her."</p>
<a id="p1616" name="p1616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1616)" >His expression brightened. "You're into that, too?"</p>
<a id="p1617" name="p1617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1617)" >I leaned on the sword. With an awkward cry, he tumbled backward over the sill and out the window. I heard frantic scrambling in the bushes as I closed and locked the shutters.</p>
<a id="p1618" name="p1618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1618)" >With a sigh, I placed my sword on the table and tiptoed to the door. I jerked it open. The landlady, on her knees at the keyhole, looked up. Sweat beaded her forehead. She might have been startled, but not a hint of embarrassment showed on her face unless it was hidden somewhere in all those wrinkles. Without rising, she lifted a platter. "Ye like chicken?"</p>

If not for a bit of moonlight, I might have missed it altogether, it was so overgrown with moss and vines, and the trees had grown up close around it. With the lantern high, I strode into the weeds.

<a id="p1714" name="p1714"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1714)" >Lord Parfum sent his men forward. "You silly bat! We know the Blair babe stole, not only your man, but most of your power, too." He gestured smugly at me. "We only needed her to clear any traps in Clarence's so-called secret tunnel."</p>
<a id="p1715" name="p1715"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1715)" >I looked from Parfum to Glenda to Bobo, and jerked my gaze away from Bobo as I felt the urge to kiss him awake again. "If you didn't want Leonardo's nephew," I muttered, "what the heck <i>are</i> you after?"</p>
<a id="p1716" name="p1716"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1716)" >He chuckled. "I told you over dinner; if you could bottle and sell whatever that brat has, you could make a fortune." A glint of insanity shone suddenly in his rodent eyes. "Bobo found a way to do that! He comes from a sorcerous family, after all. Locked in that cabinet over there is a whole case of the little stud's private brew&#151;Old Prince Charming." He laughed. "Women will never resist me again!"</p>
<a id="p1717" name="p1717"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1717)" >"You, or any man!" Glenda cried. "Bobo's brew is too strong! If one bottle is uncorked, the fumes will turn women everywhere into subservient weaklings!"</p>
<a id="p1718" name="p1718"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1718)" >Parfum nodded. "Sounds good to me." His men agreed as they flung Glenda aside and threw open the cabinet doors. Neatly racked, twenty-four glass bottles gleamed in the braziers' light.</p>
<a id="p1719" name="p1719"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1719)" >It didn't sound so good to me. I ran at Parfum, my blade upraised, but the little skunk dodged and slashed at my ribs with a small dagger. I danced away, unhurt. Two of his men hurried to his defense. I engaged them both, fighting furiously, while by the liquor cabinet, another soldier withdrew a bottle.</p>
<a id="p1720" name="p1720"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1720)" >A new player&#151;the falconer!&#151;ran out of the shadows. "I'll take that!" he said, seizing the potion. He kicked the soldier away and positioned himself before the cabinet, his sword ready. He faced four opponents&#151;I faced only three!</p>
<a id="p1721" name="p1721"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1721)" >A bolt of lightning erupted from Glenda's outstretched hand. A pile of ashes smoked at the falconer's feet. Now he faced only three. "Most, but not all my power!" she shouted.</p>
<a id="p1722" name="p1722"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1722)" >Parfum turned pale. Blinded by the sudden flash, two of the falconer's opponents stumbled back; he ran them through as I dispatched one of my own. "I hate it when a plan falls apart!" Parfum raged. His dagger whisked through the air, missing me by inches. His remaining two soldiers, on the other hand, knocked me flat as they retreated for the tunnel.</p>
<a id="p1723" name="p1723"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1723)" >Parfum was not quite ready to give up. He seized the brandy bottle and flung that at the advancing falconer. Next, he grabbed up the apple Bobo had knocked from Glenda's hand. He prepared to hurl it.</p>
<a id="p1724" name="p1724"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1724)" >But clearly his plan was ruined. With a growl, he ran to the tunnel's entrance at the old clock. There, he paused. "You can't guard that stuff forever!" he shouted. "There's no way to dispose of it! You'll hear from me again!" He flung the apple straight for the cabinet and the exposed bottles. Glenda shot out a hand, neatly intercepting it, as Parfum raced into the tunnel.</p>
<a id="p1725" name="p1725"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1725)" >A choked gurgle came from that blackness, a crunch, the sound of swallowing. A moment later, the old troll stepped from the dark, its stomach distended, a grin on its face. With one long fingernail, it picked its teeth. "Oh, you won't be hearing from him," he assured.</p>
<a id="p1726" name="p1726"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1726)" >The falconer helped me to my feet, and the troll shielded its eyes while I sheathed my sword. Glenda, after closing the cabinet, crept uncertainly forward. I read her expression. "You didn't know about the troll?"</p>
<a id="p1727" name="p1727"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1727)" >"Clarence kept a lot of secrets." Her ruby lips turned upward in a frown, but plainly it wasn't the troll that bothered her. "I can't figure how they even knew about the Prince Charming."</p>
<a id="p1728" name="p1728"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1728)" >"My fault." The falconer knelt at his queen's feet. "Leonardo and Parfum hold my sister hostage. They forced me to spy on you. Had I known they plotted the subjugation of women, I would never have cooperated. Subservience is <i>my</i> role."</p>
<a id="p1729" name="p1729"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1729)" >The old troll gave a purr of interest, but I waved it sternly back. It responded with an injured look. "I had no place else to go," it explained unasked. "This is home. Call me a prodigal!"</p>
<a id="p1730" name="p1730"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1730)" >Glenda sighed and beckoned her falconer to rise. "I can't punish you," she said. His shoulders sagged. "Not with your sister in danger."</p>
<a id="p1731" name="p1731"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1731)" >"I think I have my next case," I said. "And Leonardo's own gold will fund it." I eyed the cabinet. "But can you continue to guard that stuff alone?"</p>
<a id="p1732" name="p1732"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1732)" >Her frown deepened. "I can't dump it in the ground, can't pour it in the water supply, can't expose it to the air&#151;it's too toxic!"</p>
<a id="p1733" name="p1733"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1733)" >The troll performed a little tap dance and clapped its hands. "Let me help!" it offered. "Anybody who tries to open that cabinet is mine, and I'll clean up the bones, too!"</p>
<a id="p1734" name="p1734"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1734)" >Glenda considered, then nodded. She really had little choice, and the troll had experience as a guard.</p>
<a id="p1735" name="p1735"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1735)" >An hour later, with the falconer's belongings in a bag, we said a long good-bye at the front door. The sun was coming up, and I wanted a bath in the village before we hit the road again.</p>
<a id="p1736" name="p1736"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1736)" >As Glenda and the troll waved behind us, the falconer whispered, "Do you think they'll work out?"</p>
<a id="p1737" name="p1737"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1737)" >"An evil queen and an old troll under the same roof?" I answered. "What do you think?"</p>
