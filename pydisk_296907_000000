<a id="p598" name="p598"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(598)">"Yep," stated Dan Buckley, standing up from the bench. "It's a homing device."</p>
<a id="p599" name="p599"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(599)">"You're sure?" Chloe demanded, looking past my shoulder.</p>
<a id="p600" name="p600"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(600)">"No question." Dan turned to the Section Three scientist with whom he'd been paired since leaving the Solar System&#151;and his piloting duties&#151;behind. "Tell 'em, Izzy."</p>
<a id="p601" name="p601"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(601)">Israel Berman, Ph.D., also stood up, and ran a hand through his prematurely thinning hair. (I've always suspected that excessive brain activity inhibits hair growth. I've kept quiet with that theory since someone pointedly mentioned the exceptional thickness of my own hair.) He and Dan had struck up one of those odd friendships of opposites. I'd asked Dan to recruit him for a bit of after-hours alien-technology analysis, on a strictly unofficial basis. Thus it was that the four of us were squeezed into Berman's quarters, to which he'd brought certain instruments from his working spaces.</p>
<a id="p602" name="p602"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(602)">"Yes," he affirmed, pointing to the little trinket Khorat had given me. It lay on the bench, gleaming in the overhead lights and the table lamp Berman had trained on it. "It's in the thing that looks like a gem, at the center of the star. Amazing. But there are limits to what you can do even with molecular circuitry. It's an extremely elementary, no-frills beacon."</p>
<a id="p603" name="p603"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(603)">"What's the power source?" Chloe wanted to know.</p>
<a id="p604" name="p604"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(604)">"Would you believe a near-microscopic solar cell? Obviously, the device doesn't draw much power. This makes it practically undetectable, unless you know what you're looking for. If you do know, then it's not hard. Of course, I'm not up to actually tracing the circuitry . . . if you can even call it that. I'd need a&#151;"</p>
<a id="p605" name="p605"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(605)">"That's okay, Doc," Chloe said hastily. "We'll take your word for it. And thanks." She removed her own pin, handling it gingerly with unconscious distaste, and laid it on the bench. She turned to me. "Well, I suppose this settles what we're going to do with these things. . . ." Her voice trailed off as she watched me take mine back. "Doesn't it?"</p>
<a id="p606" name="p606"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(606)">"Yep. I plan to keep wearing mine. I want you to, as well."</p>
<a id="p607" name="p607"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(607)">"<i>What?</i> But . . . but shouldn't we go straight to Renata and report this whole incident?"</p>
<a id="p608" name="p608"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(608)">"I never like to bother her with things she doesn't need to know," I said serenely as I reattached the pin to the lapel of my suit. I'd never changed following the reception, for it was later in the same long night of Antyova II.</p>
<a id="p609" name="p609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(609)">Dan stared at me openmouthed, which was enormously satisfying. The rare opportunities that present themselves to astonish one's fellow irreverent young with one's own youthful irreverence always have that effect. (Oh, all right, I was thirty-two. But you know what I mean.) "I can't believe I'm hearing this! You're supposed to be in charge of security for this mission. And an agent of an alien power has just tried to plant a bug on you!"</p>
<a id="p610" name="p610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(610)">"First of all, Dan," I explained in tones of condescending omniscience, "we don't know that Khorat is an 'agent of an alien power.' I don't know for certain <i>who</i> he's working for . . . and I'd like to find out. Secondly, it's pretty obvious that he 'planted' these gizmos on Chloe and me in the knowledge that they'd be discovered. How about it, Dr. Berman? Didn't you say that anybody could detect these devices, given a suspicion of what they were and the requisite technological level?"</p>
<a id="p611" name="p611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(611)">"Well, yes," Berman allowed. "And everybody out here thinks we humans have that technological level&#151;with the possible exception of whatever Tonkuztra 'family' has gotten an inkling of the actual facts. And even they must know by now that we've somehow acquired the capability to use galactic-level technology even if we can't produce it."</p>
<a id="p612" name="p612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(612)">"Precisely." I nodded sagely. "So a member of a hitherto uncontacted alien race gives these things to me and Chloe, under a pretense that wouldn't fool a child, knowing that we'd be able to deduce what they are." I grew even more studiously inscrutable. "I want to know why."</p>
<a id="p613" name="p613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(613)">By now, you're probably wondering why I was being a prick of such monumental proportions. The answer is complex . . . no, correction, it's very simple. Ever since we'd departed the Moon, my job&#151;aside from strictly technical stuff&#151;had consisted of giving lectures on routine security precautions to people I knew I was boring almost as much as I was boring myself. At last, I smelled a whiff of blood. The opportunity to milk the moment for all it was worth tempted me beyond my character&#151;no great feat, according to certain unkind people.</p>
<a id="p614" name="p614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(614)">"So," Chloe said slowly, "you think we should to go along with it? Use ourselves as bait for whatever it is Khorat has in mind?" She looked gratifyingly impressed . . . or at least it was gratifying until I realized there was no telling whether she was impressed by my daring or by my insanity.</p>
<a id="p615" name="p615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(615)">"I'm not sure 'bait' is the right word. But yes, I want to play out Khorat's little game and see what happens. Something's going on here that I don't understand. That bothers me." </p>
<a id="p616" name="p616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(616)">"But Bob," Dan protested, "shouldn't you at least tell Novak what you're planning to do?"</p>
<a id="p617" name="p617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(617)">"And if I did, what do you think the chances are that she'd let me go ahead with it?"</p>
<a id="p618" name="p618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(618)">"Not very good," he admitted.</p>
<a id="p619" name="p619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(619)">"True," Chloe agreed reluctantly. "Renata does have a tendency to be kind of . . . well, you know . . ."</p>
<a id="p620" name="p620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(620)">"Anal?" I suggested helpfully.</p>
<a id="p621" name="p621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(621)">Chloe looked daggers at me, but didn't argue the point. "She'd probably order you to smash those pins with a hammer, then order all of us to avoid any contact with the delegation from Khemava, then&#151;"</p>
<a id="p622" name="p622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(622)">"&#151;Cancel all shore leave," I finished for her.</p>
<a id="p623" name="p623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(623)">This caused a glum silence to descend on the room. Novak had announced that she was going to start letting us leave the ship and play tourist. The array of limitations she'd imposed&#151;groups of two or more, no one ever to wander off individually, definite itineraries submitted in advance and strictly adhered to, <i>et cetera</i>&#151;had failed to dampen everyone's excitement at the thought of being able to explore this city beyond imagination, like something out of a superscientific <i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>
<a id="p624" name="p624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(624)">"Hmm . . . there is that," said Dan thoughtfully.</p>
<a id="p625" name="p625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(625)">"There sure is that." I nodded. "Hey, people, don't worry! Chloe and I will just go out on one of these authorized sightseeing expeditions. Novak won't have any worries about giving us permission&#151;I'm the security man, for God's sake! We'll just go around and do a lot of rubbernecking . . . and I'll see if a tail has been put on us. I have some experience in that, you know."</p>
<a id="p626" name="p626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(626)">"I suspect," Berman cautioned, "that the means of 'putting a tail' on someone are so different here that your experience will be largely irrelevant."</p>
<a id="p627" name="p627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(627)">"Care to lay a bet on it? And even if that's true, I've got some galactic-level countersurveillance stuff of my own. But I don't really expect it."</p>
<a id="p628" name="p628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(628)">"What <i>do</i> you expect?" asked Chloe. She hadn't, I was pleased to note, protested at my somewhat cavalier inclusion of her in my plans. If she had, I'd been prepared to trot out a theory&#151;doubtless completely spurious&#151;that two of the homing devices were more likely to draw the kind of attention I wanted than one.</p>
<a id="p629" name="p629"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(629)">"I'm not sure. I just want to get a reaction of some kind. You see, I have a strong hunch that Khorat is acting on his own. Or, if not strictly on his own, certainly on behalf of somebody other than his nominal Delkasu bosses. I think he gave us these doodads so he can track us when we're away from this ship and can be contacted in a more private setting than that circus of a reception. I want to see if he, or somebody else, does try to contact us."</p>
<a id="p630" name="p630"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(630)">Chloe took on the thoughtful look that was natural to her, as she slipped back into her Section Five persona. "Are you perhaps implying that there may be a power struggle of some kind going on among the Ekhemasu? And that it might offer opportunities for us?"</p>
<a id="p631" name="p631"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(631)">I noted the way she had pronounced the word <i>Ekhemasu. </i>It was sort of like the word <i>Hawaiian</i>. As you know if you've ever spent any time in Hawaii, that word can mean any citizen of the state, with no more or less significance than, say, "North Carolinian." But, with a subtly but unmistakably different intonation, it means <i>native</i> Hawaiian, the original Polynesian people of the islands. Likewise, "Ekhemasu" (a Delkasu word, as we'd learned) was what the Delkasu rulers of the empire centered on the Khemava system called themselves and all other inhabitants of that empire. But it was also their word for that system's native race, to which Khorat belonged.</p>
<a id="p632" name="p632"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(632)">Chloe, I could tell, had used the word in the former sense. And visions of exploitable fissures in that empire were dancing like visions of sugarplums through her Section Five head.</p>
<a id="p633" name="p633"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(633)">"The answer, of course, is that I don't know. We're reasoning in advance of the data, which is a capital error, as somebody&#151;"</p>
<a id="p634" name="p634"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(634)">"Sherlock Holmes," Berman put in.</p>
<a id="p635" name="p635"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(635)">"&#151;is supposed to have said. Let's get some facts to work with. We'll send up a trial balloon, and let the chips fall where they may, and . . . have I missed any clich&#381;s?"</p>
<a id="p636" name="p636"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(636)">"Not for lack of trying." But Chloe smiled as she said it.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p637" name="p637"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(637)">As it turned out, Novak gave us no real trouble about approving our outing. In fact, she was agreeable to the point of being out of character.</p>
<a id="p638" name="p638"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(638)">In theory, it wasn't even necessary for us to venture outside the ship to go exploring. Instead, one could simply sit in a recliner, put on a headband, and experience any one of the city's attractions. "Virtual reality" was a term we didn't have then, but I've learned it since. And this was far beyond what that term conjures up for you. It really <i>was</i> reality, in all its manifestations, but without reality's irritating little imperfections, and included a guide whose downloaded consciousness would respond to you interactively. I think that last part was probably the reason so few of us went that route; it summoned up too many ghosts and revenants from the tales that still lurked in the shadows amid our mental furniture, however sternly our waking minds might dismiss them in a rationalistic huff. Besides which, we just weren't ready to believe we had actually seen a city until we had actually pounded its pavement. </p>
<a id="p639" name="p639"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(639)">So the shipping line, as a matter of good customer relations, had put a few aircars at our disposal, programmed to accept verbal commands in English. Not that we were in a position to give any but the most rudimentary commands, given the awesome extent of our ignorance concerning the city. But the software&#151;another term that, for us, still lay in a future when Earth's culture had soaked up more of the galactic technology the Project had doled out&#151;was quite sophisticated enough to interpret the intent behind our fumbling, self-conscious attempts to make our wishes known. Thus it was that Chloe and I were whisked away toward the central plaza that Novak had decreed to be the beginning- and end-point of all sightseeing junkets.</p>
<a id="p640" name="p640"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(640)">The aircars were low-altitude vehicles, using underpowered versions of spaceships' impellers on a principle that was analogous to vectored thrust. As we passed through the urban canyons, I found that on this second outing I was able to absorb details in a way I hadn't on the way to the <i>Akavahn</i>'s reception, when I'd been stunned by an overload of strangeness.</p>
<a id="p641" name="p641"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(641)">Then, with an abruptness that would have been unsettling for anyone with agoraphobic tendencies, we emerged from between the walls of towering buildings and swooped over the plaza&#151;I suppose I have to call it that, even though the word has a cozy connotation, suggesting something far less vast than that expanse, like an artificial valley surrounded by equally artificial cliffs. The artistry of its pattern of alternating walkways and gardens was obvious even across the gulf that yawned between two species' artistic precepts. It was circular, and wide avenues radiated away from it like the spokes of a wheel&#151;sort of like Pierre L'Enfant's original design for Washington, but on an incomprehensibly grander scale.</p>
<a id="p642" name="p642"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(642)">The aircar set down beside a kind of kiosk that was a subsentient artificial intelligence more or less on the level of the aircars. It was a guide to the city's transportation systems, programmed to receive verbal questions and respond in kind. With our earphones and pendants, it was an oracle waiting to reveal the wonders available to us. But I hesitated before consulting it, content to stare around at the plaza itself . . . and the beings that walked among the intricate arbors of vegetation the Delkasu had brought from their unimaginably remote homeworld, filling the galaxy with it as well as with themselves.</p>
<a id="p643" name="p643"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(643)">Most of those beings were Delkasu, of course, but by no means all. This city (whose name I never learned, nor even if cities had the kind of personalized individual identity among the Delkasu that they do among humans) was the port of entry for shipping from outside the Selangava Empire. So even among the Delkasu majority, there were various styles of dress . . . and also physical variations among the wearers of those styles, barely discernible to us but doubtless charged with ethnic significance in Delkasu eyes. And, here and there among the crowds, there were others . . . enough sorts of others that Chloe and I weren't particularly noticeable.</p>
<a id="p644" name="p644"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(644)">As Dr. Fehrenbach and others had repeatedly drummed into us, the number of toolmaking races was limited. And so was their exoticism. The more outr&#381; science-fictional speculations about extraterrestrial biochemistries&#151;silicon in place of carbon, chlorine or fluorine in place of oxygen, and so forth&#151;were all very clever, but for various reasons they just didn't work. For one thing, they required planetary environments that were either flatly impossible (planets around blue giant stars) or vanishingly unlikely (massive concentrations of uncommon elements). Still, that left a lot of room for variety, quite a bit of which was on display in the plaza. I saw a biped even shorter than the Delkasu but seemingly almost as broad and thick as he was tall, with thick wrinkly brown skin and a snouted face currently wearing a device that compressed the air of Antyova II to the density to which he was accustomed on his own high-gravity planet. He walked in the careful way one adopts in low gravity. In contrast, a group of tall, attenuated, deep-chested beings with pale-gold skin and crested copper-colored ruffs of something that was neither hair nor feathers were walking laboriously and seemed to be experiencing some discomfort from the air pressure. Maybe, I thought, they thought it undignified to wear respirators that would reduce the pressure for them&#151;or maybe I was just anthropomorphizing again, reading aristocratic superciliousness into the smoothly aquiline curves of their features. There seemed three varieties of them, and I wondered if they were one of the very rare races Dr. Fehrenbach had mentioned that possessed three genders&#151;and, I imagined, very complicated lives. . . . </p>
<a id="p645" name="p645"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(645)">I felt a tug on my sleeve. Chloe pointed wordlessly at another group of beings&#151;in this case, beings we both recognized, for our briefings had included holograms of the Agardir.</p>
<a id="p646" name="p646"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(646)">Despite a certain number of "incidents" in out-of-the-way frontier systems, there was&#151;so far&#151;no official state of hostilities between them and Selangava, of which they were still technically a dependency. To date, their aggression had been limited to the spheres of colonization and commerce. (Although one heard complaints that their tactics recalled the old saw about how to tell a pirate from a merchant: if you're armed, he's a merchant.) So there was no reason for them not to be seeing the sights like the rest of us. But I don't think it was entirely my imagination that the local Delkasu shied away from them as they moved through the plaza with their distinctive sinister gait, half-loping and half-prowling, as though prepared to instantly sprint at prey.</p>
<a id="p647" name="p647"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(647)">They were bipeds approximately the height of tall men. The resemblance to humanity stopped there. There was something odd about the way their limbs were jointed. Their forms were covered with an off-white integument resembling flexible bone, if that makes any sense at all. The faces were long and narrow, reflecting the whipcord leanness of their bodies, and the heads high and flat-backed. The hands had three long, multiply jointed, mutually opposable fingers, which didn't look all that well adapted to tool-using, although the Agardir evidently got along. The feet, likewise, were three-toed, with nasty-looking claws that they kept unconsciously extending. The latter were visible beneath the saronglike garments they wore under a short jacket, in angular patterns of muted colors. </p>
<a id="p648" name="p648"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(648)">There were three of them, all male. Agardir females, I recalled, were kept almost completely secluded. They glided (no, that's not quite the right word, for the motion was quicker than that) through the crowd, which parted for them. Their heads swiveled from side to side, taking in the sights like any other tourists. . . . </p>
<a id="p649" name="p649"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(649)">Only, as I watched, it seemed as though those tiny, glittering black eyes kept coming back to Chloe and me, only to swing away as my own eyes met them.</p>
<a id="p650" name="p650"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(650)">"Come on," I heard Chloe say. "We haven't got all day, and I want to see this 'Museum of Worlds' we've heard about."</p>
<a id="p651" name="p651"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(651)">She evidently hadn't noticed the Agardir's surreptitious attention. I decided not to trouble her with it. "Yeah, sure," I replied, and began to ask the kiosk for directions. By the time I was through looking at the holo display that obligingly appeared in midair, the Agardir had moved away. But, I noted, not too far away. And their route seemed curiously aimless, as though they had no particular destination, and no purpose except to keep us in sight.</p>
<a id="p652" name="p652"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(652)">"Okay, let's go," I said to Chloe, and struck out at a pace that drew complaints from her.</p>
<a id="p653" name="p653"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(653)">Public transport in the city was designed to be usable by a multispecies clientele. Everything was coded with a simple set of symbols. (<i>Not</i> color-coded, for not all races saw in exactly the same range.) We found our way without difficulty to the moving walkway we wanted.</p>
<a id="p654" name="p654"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(654)">Those walkways were wide, and moved at a rate that would carry you to your destination at a rate that was just short of being unsettling . . . at least in their central segments. But stepping onto one of them from the adjacent pavement to either side wasn't hazardous at all, for what you stepped onto was moving at a bare crawl. As you moved closer to the center, the speed rapidly but smoothly increased, in bands marked out by brightly colored laser light-strings. And no, it wasn't a series of parallel tracks. It was continuous. It just happened to move at different rates depending on where you were. And it was all perfectly solid&#151;it was like walking on hard plastic.</p>
<a id="p655" name="p655"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(655)">No, of <i>course</i> I don't know how it was done. I'd been told about a substance which could be made solid in the vertical plane but fluid in the horizontal, in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Izzy Berman claimed to understand it, but his explanation, full of words like "anisotropic," had left me more confused than ever. Still it was a very convenient way of getting around, if a little disconcerting at first. Chloe was obviously appreciating it to the hilt. I might have done the same, if I hadn't been constantly looking back over my shoulder.</p>
<a id="p656" name="p656"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(656)">We saw wonders beyond imagination in the Museum of Worlds, presented in holographic vividness. We saw the galaxy's blazing core, seen from inside the Sagittarian dust-veils. We saw beings of every possible form life could take. We saw the remains of a long-dead race's attempt to build a Dyson Sphere . . . and also working, contemporary orbital constructs not too much less impressive than that, far beyond even what we'd seen there in the Antyova system, beyond even what seemed the ultimate limit of engineering possibilities. We saw other things less easily described&#151;<i>many</i> other things.</p>
<a id="p657" name="p657"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(657)">If only I could have concentrated.</p>
<a id="p658" name="p658"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(658)">We finally left, dazed. Chloe shook herself and found her voice. "Well, let's see . . . The next item on our list is&#151;"</p>
<a id="p659" name="p659"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(659)">But I wasn't hearing her. I'd retained enough presence of mind to scan the crowds as soon as we emerged into the Antyova light. In the distance, vainly trying to be inconspicuous among the shorter Delkasu, were three familiar tall, rangy forms.</p>
<a id="p660" name="p660"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(660)">"Right," I interrupted suddenly, grabbing Chloe by the arm. "Let's go!" I set out at a pace that required me to practically drag her.</p>
<a id="p661" name="p661"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(661)">"<i>Will</i> you slow down?" she demanded. "What's the matter with you? For God's sake, you're pulling my arm out of its socket!"</p>
<a id="p662" name="p662"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(662)">"We're being followed," I muttered into her ear. "The Three Agardir Stooges. Don't look back. Just keep up with me." I speeded up, as heedless of her struggle to match my stride as I was of the dirty looks I was getting from the Delkasu pedestrians I was making our way through with my superior mass.</p>
<a id="p663" name="p663"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(663)">This wasn't going as I'd expected. Not that I'd really known <i>what</i> to expect. But one thing I certainly <i>hadn't</i> expected was Agardir. What connection could they possibly have with the Ekhemasu Empire, or anybody in it? Unless, of course, the Ekhemasu&#151;or some faction of them, for whom Khorat was working&#151;were trying to use them to weaken Selangava from within. Yeah, that might make sense. Only . . . what the hell did it have to do with <i>us</i>? That part made <i>no</i> sense.</p>
<a id="p664" name="p664"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(664)">Chloe fumbled at her little star-shaped pin. "Let's get out of sight of them somewhere and ditch these things," she gasped.</p>
<a id="p665" name="p665"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(665)">"No. I still haven't learned a damned thing. I want to play this out a little further. But," I continued, seeing the moving walkway ahead, "getting out of their sight isn't a bad idea in itself. . . ."</p>
<a id="p666" name="p666"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(666)">Without further warning, I pulled her forward in a lunge that took us onto the slow-moving outer segment. Farther in, our fellow passengers&#151;almost all Delkasu&#151;streamed past us at varying rates of speed, up to about fifty miles an hour in the center. As Chloe and I steadied ourselves, I risked a backward glance. Our three shadows, moving in their usual predatory way, had gotten on behind us.</p>
<a id="p667" name="p667"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(667)">I put my lips beside Chloe's ear and whispered what I planned to do. Her eyes widened. "When I say 'Now,'" I repeated.</p>
<a id="p668" name="p668"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(668)">She opened her mouth to protest. I didn't give her the chance.</p>
<a id="p669" name="p669"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(669)">"<i>Now!</i>" I snapped. I grasped her arm, bunched my legs under me, and leaped across several of the speed bands. Gamely, she leaped with me. Expostulations exploded from the Delkasu we were bowling over, who had been ignoring us with the blas&#381; indifference of the urban sophisticate. Of the comments my earpiece picked up, "barbarians" was the mildest. But then we crashed to our hands and knees on one of the innermost bands. From the standpoint of the nonplussed Agardir trio, we must have shot away from them like the Road Runner from Wile E. Coyote.</p>
<a id="p670" name="p670"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(670)">Of course, I had no illusions that they'd stay nonplussed. They'd deduce which band we were on, using whatever it was they were using to track us, and get on it themselves. So they'd be ready when we started to cross the low-speed bands to get off. We needed to get off before they could do that . . . which meant immediately.</p>
<a id="p671" name="p671"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(671)">I led Chloe across the walkway to the opposite side, and we darted away toward a narrow side street. At least I darted; she did more of a fast hobble, favoring her right leg as she'd been doing ever since we'd landed so ungracefully. I had no idea where I was going. I just pressed ahead, telling myself that we'd eventually be able to find one of the kiosks and ask the way back to the central plaza. At random, I picked another corner to turn. It was a quiet street of relatively small establishments, with a kind of down-at-heels look about it that made it less intimidating than most of this city . . . not that I noticed any of that at first.</p>
<a id="p672" name="p672"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(672)">"Face-to-face" is the wrong term, for the long, pensive-seeming face atop the centauroid body was too high for that. But the being stood directly in front of us, clearly waiting.</p>
<a id="p673" name="p673"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(673)">"You!" I blurted. Even with my limited familiarity with the Ekhemasu, I was somehow certain which individual this was. When he spoke, the voice in my earpiece confirmed it, for the tiny brain assigned individual voices. And this was the voice I'd heard at the <i>Akavahn</i>'s reception.</p>
<a id="p674" name="p674"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(674)">"Come with me," said Khorat.</p>
<a id="p675" name="p675"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(675)">We goggled at him. "You've <i>got</i> to be kidding!" Chloe blurted.</p>
<a id="p676" name="p676"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(676)">"Yeah," I chimed in. "Why should we follow you when we just got through shaking your Agardir friends?"</p>
<a id="p677" name="p677"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(677)">"They are hardly my friends. A little thought will cause you to realize that there are any number of reasons why they are not . . . only one of which is that my species is purely herbivorous, and we therefore tend to feel somewhat ill at ease around carnivores. And you should come with me because that is the only way to get all the questions in your minds answered." Without further ado, Khorat turned and walked away with a horselike motion that might have been amusing in other circumstances.</p>
<a id="p678" name="p678"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(678)">Chloe and I exchanged a look. She said nothing, but I could tell she was as mystified as I. Wordlessly, we set out after Khorat.</p>
