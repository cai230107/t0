  </p>
  <p>Zo&#235; leaned against Taylor, watching as her mom slid into the taxi.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You two be good,&#8221; Tessa said with a wave.</p>
  <p>He gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. &#8220;Do we have to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Taylor!&#8221; Zo&#235; looked up at him, but he just smiled, his eyes dancing, as Tessa laughed. Instead of being entirely mortified, Zo&#235; found herself grinning back.</p>
  <p>The taxi disappeared down the Andersons&#8217; drive, and Zo&#235; blew out a breath. How had she fallen so fast? In the blink of an eye, Taylor had gone from being an idle fantasy to being a reality. How on earth was she going to get herself centered? And did she even want to?</p>
  <p>She was still wearing his sportcoat, but even so, a shiver racked her body, terrifying and enticing. Part of her wanted to run away. A bigger part of her wanted the valet to deliver the car, wanted to press Taylor up against it. Wanted to free-fall into the backseat, and do all those things she never did in high school.</p>
  <p>Slowly, without even trying, Taylor was chipping away her defenses, melting the icy fear that usually accompanied even the thought of being touched like that.</p>
  <p>She shivered again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Cold?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221; She swallowed, trying to gather her wits. &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I think you are, anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Fine, that is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s original.&#8221; Hoop sauntered toward them from the valet station, his arm around Deena.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe not original,&#8221; Taylor said, looking only at Zo&#235;. &#8220;But sincere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good answer,&#8221; Deena said, laughing, and Zo&#235; felt her entire body blush redder than her hair.</p>
  <p>She shook her head, clearing her thoughts, hoping to steer the conversation back to more manageable ground. &#8220;Sorry we had to leave you alone with Mom in marriage mode.&#8221; She tried to shift her tone back to businesslike. &#8220;We&#8217;re not engaged now or anything I should know about, right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>A slow grin spread across his face, and a feeling like warm molasses ooched down her insides.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, sweetheart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What kind of <em>anything</em> did you have in mind?&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Oh, dear</em>. The blush was back, its heat making her cheeks burn.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Behave yourself,&#8221; Hoop said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unless you don&#8217;t want him to,&#8221; Deena whispered, her voice far too low for Hoop or Taylor. Zo&#235; caught her eye, but Deena just grinned. &#8220;What? I didn&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Taylor and Hoop looked at each other.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did we miss something?&#8221; Taylor asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re men. You&#8217;re supposed to be clueless,&#8221; Deena said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That makes me the most manly man on the planet,&#8221; Hoop said.</p>
  <p>Deena kissed him on the cheek. &#8220;It certainly does.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hoop opened his mouth and then closed it again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good plan, Hoop,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;Stay quiet. Otherwise you&#8217;ll only dig yourself in deeper.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you guys supposed to be getting a dose of culture right about now?&#8221; Zo&#235; asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Righto,&#8221; Hoop said. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the valet with the car? We need to get going.&#8221; He grinned and sucked in a breath, then belted out, &#8220;Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit!&#8221; at the top of his lungs.</p>
  <p>The few folks waiting at the valet stand turned, a half dozen pairs of eyes wide and curious.</p>
  <p>Deena raised her eyes to the sky. &#8220;That&#8217;s our cue.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank goodness for that,&#8221; Zo&#235; said.</p>
  <p>Hoop shrugged, the grin taking over his face. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? You don&#8217;t appreciate culture?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m just a philistine,&#8221; Zo&#235; said.</p>
  <p>Hoop nodded his head toward Taylor. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything I wouldn&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, that leaves my options pretty wide open,&#8221; Taylor said, his intense look once again reducing Zo&#235; to shakes and shivers. <em>&#8220;Is</em> there anything you wouldn&#8217;t do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A few things. Maybe. But if I say them out loud, I might get arrested.&#8216;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deena walloped him with her purse, and he held up his hands to defend himself. They were still play-wrestling&#8212;the party guests watching them with amused expressions&#8212;when the valet pulled up in Hoop&#8217;s battered Jeep. Hoop whisked Deena into his arms, planted a kiss on her mouth, then helped her up into the passenger seat before climbing behind the wheel.</p>
  <p>Taylor swung his arm around Zo&#235;&#8217;s shoulder as Hoop pulled away, Deena riding backward in the open Jeep so she could wave and throw kisses. &#8220;They&#8217;re quite a pair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perfect for each other,&#8221; Zo&#235; agreed. She tried not to look at Taylor as she smothered a wave of forest green envy.</p>
  <p>She wanted what Deena and Hoop had&#8212;that closeness, that playfulness, that sense of being almost one person. And the possibility that she&#8217;d never find it scared her.</p>
  <p>She glanced up at Taylor, silently admitting that the possibility she&#8217;d already found it&#8212;but couldn&#8217;t keep it&#8212; scared her even more.</p>
  <p>
   <br />
   <br />
  </p>
  <p>It was amazing what one could accomplish at Radio Shack. While Zo&#235; and her little human friend were downing cocktails on the lawn, Mordi had dashed to the nearest mall&#8212;not a long trek in southern California&#8212; and acquired a few key electronic components.</p>
  <p>A few wires here, a transistor there, a capacitor hooked up in the middle, and voila! One tracking device returned to prime working order. He hoped his dad was watching. At least somebody in the family knew how to work with electronics.</p>
  <p>He watched the little green blip blinking right above the house where he again perched like an owl, his cloak draped over his shoulders. Zo&#235; and Mr. Taylor were down there, along with their mortal friends. Eventually Zo&#235; and the detective would split up&#8212;and Mordi would have his chance. He&#8217;d simply follow the bouncing green ball all the way back into his father&#8217;s good graces.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Blip, blip, bleep.</em>
  </p>
  <p>He perked up. The blip was on the move.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, unlike his cousin, supersight wasn&#8217;t one of his talents. Which meant he had to whip out his handy binoculars to get a visual on exactly who was moving&#8212;Zo&#235; or the detective.</p>
  <p>He pressed the glasses against his face and focused, the crowd changing from fuzzy relief to perfect clarity. He trained the lenses over the front porch, scanning the faces, until finally ... he saw ...</p>
  <p>
   <em>Both of them?</em>
  </p>
  <p>&#8220;What in the name of Pluto is going on?&#8221; he said with a snarl. With a jerk, he ripped the binocs away, lost his balance, and went scuttling down the roof, his heels and rear sending tile shingles flying. Reaching out, he grabbed hold of the rain gutter and hung there, suspended by just his fingertips, totally exposed to whomever might be looking.</p>
  <p>He shouldn&#8217;t have worried. Being a rather unobservant lot, the nearby mortals on the ground didn&#8217;t even look up. And not one person noticed him literally hanging from his fingertips. Really, it was a wonder mortals had ever managed to drag themselves out of the primordial swamp.</p>
  <p>Suspended four stories high, he swayed a bit, pondering his predicament. What to do? What to do?</p>
  <p>Reconnaissance first. With his free hand, he pulled his cloak closed and fastened it. Then he grabbed up the binocs. Surely he must have seen wrong. Either Zo&#235; or Taylor must have left. After all, the blip was moving.</p>
  <p>He peered down, finally focusing in on Zo&#235;. She stood there, a little smile on her face, laughing a bit as she talked to&#8212;he shifted his perspective a bit to the left&#8212; the detective.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Damn!</em>
  </p>
  <p>The realization jolted him, and he clenched his fist to pound it against the roof. Unfortunately it was the hand that was holding on to the gutter, which meant that he <em>stopped</em> holding on to the gutter. Which meant that he fell. Four stories. All the way to the ground.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Bloody hell.</em>
  </p>
  <p>From behind the hydrangea bushes, he frowned in the general direction of the driveway. If Zo&#235; was there and the detective was there and the blip was moving, that could only mean one thing: someone else had the stone.</p>
  <p>But who?</p>
  <p>With a little grunt, he stood up, straightening his suit, wiping bits of leaf and grass off the finely tailored London original. He paused, his hand hovering over the seat of his pants, wondering if he&#8217;d damned the situation too soon.</p>
  <p>After all, the little blip had been centered right above Zo&#235;. Zo&#235; was still there, but the blip had gone bye-bye.</p>
  <p>The mortal girl. The stone must be with Zo&#235;&#8217;s friend.</p>
  <p>He smiled.</p>
  <p>That had to be the explanation. And it made things even easier. All he had to do was follow her with the tracking device and then, when the moment was ripe, make his move.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
  <p>The flame from the gaslight at the end of the Andersons&#8217; driveway flickered and danced, splashing orange light across Zo&#235;&#8217;s hair. Taylor sucked in a breath, savoring the moment.</p>
  <p>She looked ethereal, unreal. A goddess. <em>His</em> goddess.</p>
  <p>When she smiled at him, his heart fluttered. Lord, how this woman made his soul sing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re staring,&#8221; she said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She nodded, then leaned up against the lamppost, mischief shining in her eyes. &#8220;What are you looking at, sailor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The most beautiful woman in port.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Her cheeks flushed, and Taylor&#8217;s body tightened in response. She was innocent, sweet, yet sexy as hell.</p>
  <p>There was never a bed around when he needed one.</p>
  <p>He mentally kicked himself. He wanted her in his bed&#8212;or her bed, he wasn&#8217;t picky&#8212;but that wasn&#8217;t all he wanted. Oh, yes, he wanted to seduce her, wanted her to want him just as desperately. But he also wanted to understand everything there was to know about her, and to explore those intimate secrets even she didn&#8217;t know yet.</p>
  <p>Oh, yeah, all that was what he wanted, all right. Where the hell was the damn car?</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still staring,&#8221; she said, her delighted grin making it absolutely clear that she didn&#8217;t mind at all.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still beautiful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If possible, her flush deepened, and she dropped her gaze. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He took a step closer. &#8220;Alone at last,&#8221; he said, moving closer still, not touching her, but near enough that, if he concentrated, he was sure he could feel the desire thrumming through her.</p>
  <p>She looked relaxed, but he knew she wasn&#8217;t. He knew because he was wound up tight, just waiting for release in her arms, her lips. <em>Her</em>.</p>
  <p>When she looked up, there was no mistaking the passion in her eyes. &#8220;There are still people waiting for their cars. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Right then and there he decided he&#8217;d waited long enough for the damn car. He took her hand and she moaned slightly, her breath fluttery. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Somewhere where there aren&#8217;t people waiting for their cars.&#8221; He leaned closer to whisper in her ear. &#8220;Somewhere we can be alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What about the car?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Screw the car.&#8221; He tugged her toward him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Taylor, are you planning to seduce me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I am. Do you mind?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The burning desire shining in her eyes was real, and the shy honesty in her voice just about did him in. &#8220;I&#8217;d be disappointed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <br />
   <br />
  </p>
  <p>The pathway twisted across the rocky slope, wending its way along the cliff above where the ocean beat against the shore. Zo&#235; peered over the edge, watching froth leap and dance above the wave-polished rocks, the magnificent force of nature nothing compared to the tempest raging within her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A beautiful view,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She turned to smile at him, then realized he wasn&#8217;t looking at the view, but at her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I want to kiss you, Zo&#235;.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re afraid of anything.&#8221; She said it with a grin, but although he smiled back, there was something hidden in his eyes. He blinked, and his eyes cleared, leaving Zo&#235; to wonder if she&#8217;d imagined it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I <em>am</em> afraid,&#8221; he said, the admission making her a little relieved she wasn&#8217;t the only one. &#8220;Afraid that if I start to kiss you, I won&#8217;t be able to stop.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She stepped closer, anticipating his lips on hers, steadying herself for the shock of his touch. With a little grin, she wrapped her arms around his waist. &#8220;Well, Mr. Taylor. What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, sweetheart.&#8221; His words drifted toward her on a wisp of air, caressing her as softly as his hand gently cupped her cheek. She pressed her face against his palm, letting the warmth of his skin seep into her blood, letting her blood and his heat burn through her veins.</p>
  <p>Her body lingered on the verge of ignition. Reveling in the torment, she turned her face, relishing the rough feel of his callused hand against her cheek, pressing her lips to his palm. He moaned, the soft sound sweeter to her ears than the purest musical note.</p>
  <p>Except... there was another sound, too.</p>
  <p>She twisted her head, trying to hear. &#8220;What was that?&#8221; Whatever it was, it meant <em>kissus interruptus</em>, and that was bad.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do you hear that?&#8221; she asked, knowing the answer. The sound was too soft, too subtle. Even for her, it was almost inaudible. But it was there, low and threatening. Like a growl, or a low wail.</p>
  <p>He hooked a finger under her chin and looked into her eyes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear anything but you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She smiled, but shook her head. &#8220;No, there&#8217;s something out there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He pulled back, immediately tense, ready to fight. His determination to protect her warmed Zo&#235; to her very soul, even though she of all people didn&#8217;t need a hero. &#8220;Something?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or someone.&#8221; Then she saw it&#8212;a rustling in the brush off to the right. &#8220;There.&#8221; She pointed, automatically stepping in front of him.</p>
  <p>Just as automatically, he gripped her shoulders, pushing her aside and stepping in front of her. &#8220;What do you see?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She sidled forward again, trying to get in front of him without being conspicuous, wanting to protect him. She squinted as she looked over the rims of her glasses, her nose wrinkling from a sudden stench, and once again Taylor moved in front of her. She stifled a grin at his persistent chivalry.</p>
  <p>How in Hades could she describe what she saw&#8212;two creatures crouching among the leaves, one tall and thin, the other short and squatty. A greenish slime seemed to coat them both, and their mouths hung open, drool dripping off their big, pointy overbites.</p>
  <p>On the round one, folds of scaled fat fell over more folds of fat. The skinny one had none, its skin seemingly clinging to pure bone, as if the fat one had taken his share. Their noxious odor drifted toward her, like rotten eggs mixed with curdled milk.</p>
  <p>She bit back a gag and tried to decide what to do.</p>
  <p>If Taylor could see these ... <em>things</em>, she&#8217;d have some serious explaining to do.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those guys look strung out.&#8221; Taylor stepped sideways, centering himself between Zo&#235; and the two cretins in the bushes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Guys?&#8221; One eyebrow arched up.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I realize it&#8217;s giving them more credit than they deserve,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;But &#8216;asshole junkies&#8217; seemed a little strong.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; She pushed her glasses firmly up her nose. &#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She sounded so confused, he turned around to look at her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Just let me handle it and we&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; He squinted. &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine. I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; she said brightly.</p>
  <p>But of course he knew she wasn&#8217;t. How could she be? Hell, she was an elementary school librarian. Apart from that run-in with that police impersonator, Taylor was certain that the closest Zo&#235; came to the wrong side of the law was chasing down people with overdue library books. And Taylor intended to keep it that way.</p>
  <p>Her brow creased. &#8220;So you think they&#8217;re just two guys hanging out in the bushes?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What I think is that we should get out of here.&#8221; He took her hand and started heading back toward the Andersons&#8217; house. &#8220;If they are junkies, they probably wouldn&#8217;t have any qualms about jumping us&#8212;not if they thought it might get them enough cash for their next hit.&#8221;</p>
  <p>His thigh ached, and he idly rubbed it. Whether she&#8217;d meant to hire him as a protector or a date, either way, he was there. And he didn&#8217;t intend to let her down.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He took her hand and hurried her down the path.</p>
  <p>After a few seconds, she stopped.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Footsteps. Behind us.&#8221; She started moving again, tugging him forward. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get you&#8212;I mean us&#8212;out of here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He slowed a bit, listening. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She stepped behind him and nudged him with her shoulder. &#8220;Keep listening. You will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Nodding, he moved on. Most likely she was just nervous, and wanted to get away as fast as possible. He would have been smart not to have said anything at all&#8212; to have just headed back to the house without clueing her in to their uninvited companions.</p>
  <p>Now the poor girl was imagining footsteps and bogeymen. And no wonder. It wasn&#8217;t as if she&#8217;d led a life of adventure, and here he was, dropping her into the middle of a situation that was decidedly <em>not</em> Capraesque.</p>
  <p>He glanced over his shoulder and saw a shadow waver behind them on the darkened path. <em>Uh-oh.</em> Maybe Zo&#235; was right. Maybe the whacked-out weirdos were following them after all.</p>
  <p>He thought of the strange man impersonating an officer earlier and wondered if there was more to these druggie creeps than the need for a fix. Were these guys following them with a more nefarious purpose? And were they following him or Zo&#235;?</p>
  <p>Certainly not her. She&#8217;d seemed genuinely perplexed in the car. And he couldn&#8217;t imagine anything in the life of a librarian that would attract such unpleasant attention. He, on the other hand, had recently been hired to locate a very large, very missing, very expensive gemstone.</p>
  <p>Maybe he wasn&#8217;t the only one-looking for it....</p>
  <p>
   <em>Damn it!</em> He&#8217;d jumped so hard and so fast at the possibility of ten grand he hadn&#8217;t even considered the consequences, had basically blown off Hoop&#8217;s concern that it might be hot. And now he&#8217;d gone and embroiled Zo&#235;&#8216; in the twisted little plot.</p>
  <p>Trying to hurry&#8212;without <em>looking</em> like he was hurrying&#8212;he took her elbow and moved her along.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are we hurrying?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nope. Just strolling.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She sped up. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whatever you want.&#8221;</p>
  <p>They started walking faster, Zo&#235; taking the lead and Taylor pumping hard, trying to keep up.</p>
  <p>She took his hand and sped up. Taylor started trotting.</p>
  <p>She sped up again. Taylor started running.</p>
  <p>The trees started passing faster than they usually did when he jogged on the beach, and the wind cut into his face the way it did when he rode a roller-coaster. A stitch started in his side. His lungs burned; his thigh screamed.</p>
  <p>He glanced over at Zo&#235;, who looked about as winded as someone out for an evening stroll. &#8220;You ... work ... out, right?&#8221; he managed, sucking in air as they chugged along.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yeah. Sure. Lots.&#8221; She caught his eye. &#8220;Too fast?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he lied, clutching his side and gasping. He gave up. So much for being macho; this was the new millennium, after all. Coughing, he stopped, bent over, and sucked in gallons of glorious oxygen.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Air</em>, God, how he loved the feel of air in his lungs.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sorry.&#8221; Zo&#235; stopped and jogged backward to him. &#8220;I get a little carried away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hell, lady. You could qualify for the Olympics.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She laughed, but it sounded a little forced ... and then her eyes went wide.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What? Am I turning red? I do that when I&#8217;m winded sometimes.&#8221; His hands were still perched just above his knees&#8212;his favorite gasping-for-air position&#8212;but when he looked up, he saw asshole junkie number one reflected in her glasses. And this was one fellow who definitely looked like there was more on his mind than a walk on the beach. He was lunging forward.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aw, hell.&#8221; Whipping around, he kicked his leg out, ignoring the screaming of his thigh, his only thought of keeping Zo&#235; safe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Taylor, <em>no</em>!&#8221;</p>
  <p>His leg connected squarely with the fat one&#8217;s jaw, but instead of the reassuring crack he&#8217;d expected, he heard an anticlimactic slooshing sound, a bit like he&#8217;d just karate-kicked a jellyfish. <em>Man, this is one drugged up son of a bitch who really needs to go on a diet</em>.</p>
  <p>The slug sank to the ground, a nice imprint of the bottom of Taylor&#8217;s shoe tattooed onto the side of his face. Rushed with victory, Taylor looked up at Zo&#235;, whose eyes were still wide.</p>
  <p>He had just enough time to say &#8220;What?&#8221; when it registered&#8212;he&#8217;d seen the fat one, but there had been a skinny one, too. And before he could do anything, a bony little arm locked around his neck.</p>
  <p>In front of him, Zo&#235; bounced up and down, looking like she wanted to jump into the fray.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stay back,&#8221; he said, except with Skinny&#8217;s arm pressing against his windpipe, it came out sounding more like <em>stray cats</em>.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; She squinted, looking from him to Skinny, then back to him again. And she was still bouncing, that &#8220;I really wanna help&#8221; look plastered on her face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Got.. . under . . . control,&#8221; he managed to spit out, then realized with a bit of horror that his feet were no longer on the ground. The fact that he was about to pass out from lack of oxygen did not&#8212;<em>repeat, not</em>&#8212;mean that he was any less in control. <em>Nope, didn&#8217;t mean that at all. Didn&#8216;t, didn&#8217;t, didn&#8216;t</em>.</p>
  <p>He realized what an odd-sounding word <em>didn&#8217;t</em> was, and decided that maybe <em>control</em> was overstating things, especially considering he was getting a little loopy from lack of air.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Whizzzzzzzzzz</em>! Something zinged over his head, and he heard a <em>thwack</em> as the something connected with Skinny&#8217;s head. All of a sudden Taylor&#8217;s feet were back on the ground, and his lungs were filling with oxygen.</p>
  <p>Things were looking up.</p>
  <p>One glance at Zo&#235; confirmed that she was all right. More or less, anyway. She was staring&#8212;almost trance-like&#8212;at a point just over his head. Taylor whirled around, leading with his fist, and caught Skinny&#8212;who was standing there motionless like an idiot&#8212;square on the jaw. For a moment the junkie just teetered, almost as if he were drugged. Then he yelped and hightailed it down the path.</p>
  <p>What a strange reaction to a punch, but the result was right.</p>
  <p>He tossed a smile Zo&#235;&#8217;s way. &#8220;Guess that wraps up the fun for tonight. Join us for another mugging tomorrow. Same bat time, same bat channel.&#8221; Then he sank to the ground.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
  <p>He was making jokes. <em>Thank goodness</em>. She&#8217;d been afraid she hadn&#8217;t acted fast enough and one of the nitwits had hurt him. Of course, Taylor&#8217;d managed to take care of Nit all on his own, but Wit&#8217;s necklock hadn&#8217;t exactly looked comfortable.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; She knelt down beside him, checking his neck for bruising.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221; His gaze swept over her, the inspection stirring her blood. &#8220;How about you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Not fine at all</em>. But that had more to do with the way he was looking at her than what had happened with Nit and Wit. She forced herself to lie. &#8220;No problems here. You took care of them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they were junkies after all,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I think they were after me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She remembered the fangs and the drool and the really gross smell, and silently disagreed. Out loud she said, &#8220;Oh?&#8221;</p>
  <p>What she really wanted to ask was, <em>Didn&#8217;t you see the fangs? The slimy drool? The one eye instead of two? Do you really think those cretins were your average, everyday junkies</em>?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yeah. I just took on a new job. I&#8217;m tracking down an heirloom. Possibly stolen. Maybe they figure I&#8217;ve got a lead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221; If he thought he knew where Nit and Wit came from, she wasn&#8217;t going to argue. It guaranteed her secret was still safe.</p>
  <p>She stifled a sigh. For Taylor, there was no drool, no fangs, just a couple of muggers out for a Sunday stroll.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, trying to sound chipper. &#8220;The important thing is you&#8217;re okay.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Okay? I&#8217;m great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everyone says so,&#8221; he added confidentially and smiled. Then he stood up and helped her to her feet.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Everyone?&#8221; she asked, looking at him pointedly and fighting a laugh.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, so now you&#8217;re a detractor?&#8221; He said it with a grin, and she had to admit he looked pretty scrumptious.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, trying to sound grudging, but not succeeding very well, &#8220;I suppose you might be a little great.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Great is an all-or-nothing thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She laughed. &#8220;Greedy, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>He swung an arm around her and lowered his mouth to her ear. &#8220;Insatiable,&#8221; he whispered, clearly pleased with himself.</p>
  <p>Well, why shouldn&#8217;t he be? He&#8217;d saved her from the bogeyman. Or at least that was what <em>he</em> thought.</p>
  <p>The truth wasn&#8217;t quite so straightforward.</p>
  <p>He looped his arm through hers and they headed back toward the car in silence, Taylor most likely reliving his victory, Zo&#235; definitely reliving hers.</p>
  <p>Taylor had called them <em>men</em>. But they weren&#8217;t men. Not at all. And when the skinny one had been dangling Taylor from one slime-covered tentacle thing, she&#8217;d been helpless. If she&#8217;d fought, if she&#8217;d lashed out and beat the bugger to a pulp, Taylor would surely have been suspicious. To say the least.</p>
  <p>So she&#8217;d ripped a button off Taylor&#8217;s coat and flung it at the beast, hitting the noxious creature square on the nose and stunning it. But then Taylor hadn&#8217;t gotten away fast enough, and when the enraged beast was about to pummel him, Zo&#235; had reacted on instinct, aiming a burst of concentration right between the dufus&#8217;s bugged-out eyes.</p>
  <p>And it had worked.</p>
  <p>That was the truly amazing thing. Never in a million years had she thought that thinking really hard could rank up there on the list of top-ten ways to ward off ugly idiots. Who knew? She&#8217;d aimed her superstare in his direction, Wit had frozen, Taylor&#8217;d gotten in a solid punch, and the little creep had taken off, a groggy Nit following right behind.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Easy-squeezy.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Just a few days ago she could barely levitate a book. Now she was going all gonzo with telekinetic power. How cool was that? Except she shuddered to think what would have happened if the now fully functional Zo&#235; Smith superstare hadn&#8217;t worked. Either Taylor would have been monster fodder, or Zo&#235; would have had to put some of her martial arts on display.</p>
  <p>She shivered, and Taylor pulled her closer, smiling down at her. Automatically she smiled back, feeling absurdly safe just being in his arms. Absurd because Taylor didn&#8217;t really up her safety quotient. Heck, she could lay the man out in two seconds flat, but still...</p>
  <p>She sighed. There was something special about just being held by him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You sure you&#8217;re okay?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>She tilted her head back, basking in the warmth of his luscious brown eyes. &#8220;Oh, yeah. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; But even more than before, she was sure Taylor was far from fine. If he got caught in the cross fire of her testing, if Nit and Wit decided to make an encore appearance ...</p>
  <p>She needed to send him on his way&#8212;safe back into Hollywood, where at least he was familiar with the bad guys. Where the bad guys were <em>guys</em>, not monsters in men suits. He&#8217;d never be safe with her.</p>
  <p>They stopped in front of Francis Capra, the only car in the drive now that the guests had all left. She leaned against the back while Taylor opened the door for her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We ought to get you home. Some hot chocolate, some rest.&#8221; He trailed a fingertip down her cheek, and it was all she could do not to gasp. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a traumatic evening.&#8221; He kissed his fingertip and pressed it against the end of her nose. &#8220;Maybe set you up on the couch, tuck a fluffy blanket around you, watch a funny movie ...&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Oh, no</em>. With sudden certainty, she knew that she wasn&#8217;t about to settle for a PG-rated night with Taylor.</p>
  <p>Heck, she wasn&#8217;t even going to settle for R.</p>
  <p>No, as scary as it was&#8212;as much as she was sure that she would practically explode from his touch, not to mention his kisses&#8212;Zo&#235; knew one thing for sure.</p>
  <p>Tonight, she wanted X-rated. Wanted it bad.</p>
  <p>With what she hoped was a sultry smile, she reached up and stroked his cheek, banishing thoughts of Nit and Wit, pushing away worries about any of the council&#8217;s tests. Right now she wanted only to think about Taylor. Gently, she turned his face toward hers. &#8220;No hot chocolate, no blankies. Just you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Zo&#235;, we were attacked. This isn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;<em>You</em>,&#8221; she said with more force.</p>
  <p>She hooked her arms around his neck and pulled herself up on her tip toes. She brushed her lips over his, calling on every ounce of concentration to stay focused when her lips tingled from the butterfly-soft kiss. &#8220;You can try to stop me, of course,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seduced a hero before, but I intend to go down fighting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Taylor moaned, his hands caressing her back, pulling her closer against him until her body burned with the heat of a thousand suns. &#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dream of disappointing a lady.&#8221;</p>

  <p>Hieronymous drummed his fingers on his desk, his manicured nails click-clacking on the polished wood.</p>
  <p>&#8220;They failed,&#8221; Clyde said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am aware of that.&#8221; What should have been such a simple task&#8212;obtaining the stone, getting rid of Zo&#235; and taking over the world&#8212;was becoming much too complicated.</p>
  <p>&#8220;They were out of practice, they were,&#8221; Clyde went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s from being locked up so long.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is no excuse.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Clyde pulled himself up and to attention. &#8220;No, sir. Shall I dispose of them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hieronymous tilted his head, considering. On one hand, the creatures had failed with a relatively simple task. On the other . ..</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. They may still prove useful.&#8221; He glanced at the center monitor, now displaying the Los Angeles skyline. &#8220;Depending on how Mordichai fares, they may still prove useful, indeed.&#8221;</p>
