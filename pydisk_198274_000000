<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Enemy  in  sight!"  the signal came from  the  Athena  just 
        ahead, the flashes of light from the flagship's stern leaving  no 
        doubt of what laid ahead!  "Five ships!" the flashing light said!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Battle stations, all ahead three quarters," I snapped then.  
        The alarm whistle sounding through the length of the armored  Di-
        ana  as  we pulled up on the steam frigate ahead and  started  to 
        move  around.  I saw the forward hatches being closed, the  Diana 
        being "buttoned up" for battle.  There was little doubt that  the 
        enemy would use fire, although it was not "effective" against us.  
        Lorraine  said that she guessed that Princess Tara had given  the 
        orders, the Mexican Warlady no doubt now claiming that the use of 
        an invulnerable "ironclad" like the Diana was in violation of the 
        "codes" that govern all naval warfare here in this barbaric era.*
        
        * This actually became an "issue" during the construction of  the 
        Diana  in Arsana.  A number of the military castes claiming  that 
        the construction of a "battleship" was against the caste codes in 
        that such a "vessel" was "invulnerable" against "ordinary arms".
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Three of their first rates, two second rates," Carol  said, 
        lowering the telescope.  The first rates were square rigged steam 
        frigates, much like the Imperials, but not as well "designed"  as 
        Lorraine's ships were in that they still lacked the top gallants.  
        The second rates were simple "sailers", carrying that odd  combi-
        nation of a square and fore and aft rig that the Mexicans seem to 
        like.  We were now up alongside the Athena, the crew of the Impe-
        rial  flagship waving and cheering us on.  I "assumed" that  they 
        were  cheering us, judging from their activities, although  given 
        the  constant heavy "thud-thud" noise of the triple  engines  and 
        everything  else the interior of the Diana when "buttoned up"  as 
        we were now is not a quiet place by any means, I can assure you.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Princess Tara has a better `spy network' than even the  Im-
        perials,"  Sandra commented, it being obvious that  the  Mexicans 
        had  started  on building steam frigates almost as soon  as  Lor-
        raine's ship had steamed out of Trella's harbor late last winter.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "A woman with a well `deserved' reputation," I smiled  back, 
        the Princess being quite "familiar" with such designs, no doubt.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Lorraine  says that they are building one of these,"  Carol 
        answered,  holding the telescope to her eye, peering through  one 
        of the small glass covered slits.  I doubted that she saw much...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Man  is a `weapon making animal'," I smiled,  quoting  some 
        now forgotten Twentieth Century author I'd once read so long ago.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "If it wasn't for the Priestesses we'd be using cannon now," 
        my wife answered, lowering the telescope.  I nodded, smiled back.  
        The basic technology of this era had been severely "strained"  by 
        the construction of the Diana.  On the other hand muzzle  loading 
        cannon  wouldn't be that "hard" to make if Tais ever allowed  it.  
        And the design of the Diana was "ideal" for such weapons, I felt, 
        visions of "battle" between steam powered "ironclads" in my mind, 
        the famous battle there in the American Civil War coming to mind.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We  have never learned to live in peace with ourselves,"  I 
        heard Sandra suddenly mutter, I think more to herself than to us.  
        I thought it was true.  Even after the "experiences" of the  past 
        we still fought each other like predatory animals.  Perhaps it is 
        the  fate of Man to always fight, always to "know" war.  We  have 
        lived at peace only when under the "heel" of a greater conquering 
        power.   One thinks of Rome at its glory, of Janet Rogers'  World 
        Federation  of  the 21st Century.  There was no "war"  then,  al-
        though  Janet certainly had enough "terrorists" to deal with  ac-
        cording to the history books.  The "name" changes, but the reali-
        ty still remains the "same".  There are always those who seek  to 
        take  away the freedoms, the "rights" of others.  No  doubt  they 
        existed  when Homo Erectus roamed the Earth half a million  years 
        ago.   We speak of "great conquerors", of Alexander, Julius  Cae-
        sar,  of Napoleon, of Hitler and Stalin, Chairman Mao.  Of  Janet 
        Rogers,  who "conquered" the entire world and made it "her  own".  
        Then  here in this time we have Darlanis, a woman with  "dreams", 
        who perhaps sees herself as being the "second Janet Rogers" now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "On the other hand," Carol replied then, "We `live' in a way 
        that  `those' who know not war will never know."  I thought  then 
        that she spoke the truth.  I recalled the words that Lorraine had 
        written about the Lorr, about the Women.  Two totally  "stagnant" 
        races,  one "alien", one "human", sharing a dying  desert  world.  
        Of the two only the Women had any interest in exploration, in be-
        ing anything more than just a life form much like the ants  unno-
        ticed there beneath our feet.  Perhaps "war" is the price we  pay 
        for being an aggressive, assertive life form that perhaps someday 
        will seek the stars if the Priestesses of Lys ever do allow it...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "All ahead full," I spoke, breaking into this  conversation.  
        "Forward  flamethrowers and quickfirers ready," I barked, my  or-
        ders being swiftly relied by midshipman Anders to those  forward.  
        The helmsman then surrendering the wheel and controls to me  now.  
        Sandra went below to the main deck to check our battleworthiness.  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Once  again we stand together," Carol said, her hand on  my 
        shoulder, her hazel eyes meeting mine.  I thought of the Arena at 
        Trella, of the sands, the sun burning down.  Of a brownette naked 
        but  for a bit of leather, a sword glistening there in her  hand.  
        The five enemy ships were about a couple miles away now,  closing 
        the distance between us even though they stood no chance  against 
        the Diana.  We were "vulnerable" to nothing short of "ramming"...  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "As it should be," I said, touching her hand with mine now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I am `part' of you, and you are `part' of me," Carol said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Lorraine is not the only one who thinks `deep thoughts'," I 
        smiled back at my brownette.  I saw Carol nod, a smile curve  her 
        lovely lips.  We "belonged" together, Carol and I, like few "do".
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The `destiny' of a world is in our hands," she said to me.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm glad you didn't stay in Arsana," I said to my beloved.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "What we `have' is `important' to me," Carol spoke softly. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We don't `belong' in this world," I said to my brownette.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We're just `hired guns' carrying out the wishes of others," 
        my wife answered, staring at the rapidly approaching five ships.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The `cause' for which we fight is `just'," I answered her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That doesn't alter the `reality' of what we are," she said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I am going to engage the enemy from seawards," I answered.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That seems wise," the Warlady of Dularn answered me back.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The Mexican turned, firing everything he had, trying to ram.  
        I  saw the bow of the Diana blazing with burning oil,  heard  the 
        sound of the forward quickfirers, all four forward and the turret 
        above our heads.  Fifteen missiles a second falling like a deadly 
        hail on his decks.  The ram hit just astern, the flamethrower now 
        spraying its deadly stream of fire.  He was done for even  before 
        the  Diana broke free to seek her second victim.  The second  had 
        come about to try to face us, the third following at his heels...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Ram to ram," Carol breathed, the Mexican coming down on us.  
        I reversed the engines, hit him with both flamethrowers, the  Di-
        ana backing away at full power.  Daris Adara was good down in the 
        engine room throwing those levers over in that steamy oven  below 
        decks.  She and her sweating crew now quick to follow my orders.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Third one now," I said, Carol at my side, watching, the Di-
        ana now again racing forward to meet her "enemy" like a  charging 
        iron  clad monster.  It was hard to see through the  flames  that 
        burned  before the control room slits, the odor of  burning  lamp 
        oil  heavy in the air.  Curses from above left no  doubts  either 
        that  some  of it had come in through the firing  slit  over  our 
        heads.  Midshipman Anders having a rather "surprising" vocabulary 
        for one so "young" and pretty, I laughed to my wife just then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The Diana and the enemy hit almost side to side, the frigate 
        taking the full spray of our flamethrowers as we churned on past.  
        The  two second rates running for safety, the Athena charging  on 
        down  at them.  Behind us now three blazing ships, terrified  men 
        leaping  into the sea to escape the leaping flames as  the  Diana 
        came about to view the horrors that our flamethrowers had caused.  
        Sandra  scrambling up the ladder to stand at my wife's side,  the 
        look on the blonde's face leaving no doubts as to her thoughts...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "An `impressive' victory," Lorraine said, standing there  on 
        the  deck of her flagship.  Behind us burned the last of the  two 
        second rates, the crews having been put ashore and the ships both 
        set  ablaze by the Athena's own flamethrowers.  The  Diana  lying 
        alongside like a great monster of the deep, the painted hull  now 
        burned in places from the blazing oil that had fallen upon her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I suppose one could call it that," I answered her back.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "No injuries worth noting," Sandra said to me when I stepped 
        back aboard the Diana, the open hatches now clearing the interior 
        of the odor of burning lamp oil.  Carol giving me a smile as  she 
        stood  there beside the captain.  The crew of the Diana  standing 
        there  watching, their own "silence" a tribute to the  dead  we'd 
        left behind there floating among the drifting embers of the three 
        steam  frigates.  I recalled the "end" of Sarnian Lady  the  year 
        before from the use of a flamethrower.  The "reactions" of Darla-
        nis  to the "use" of such a weapon.  The Mexicans had  been  much 
        the same.  I thought of another era, the "use" of another weapon.  
        The  effects of "modern" warfare with the Diana and  its  weapons 
        were much like that of Hiroshima.  As Carol had said, we were but 
        "hired guns".  Not really people of this era despite  everything.  
        Torn from our home by the awesome power of the Priestesses of Lys 
        to fight in wars six centuries in our future.  Unlike the Warlady 
        of the Imperials, we really never had "belonged" in this "world".
