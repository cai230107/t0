<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_14"></a><b>CHAPTER 14&#160;</b></h1>
<a id="p809" name="p809"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(809)" align="center">&#160;</p>
<a id="p810" name="p810"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(810)">Dennis wasn't sure how long they'd been walking when he saw the light. It was a soft gleam, yellowish orange, not far off the trail.&#160;</p>
<a id="p811" name="p811"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(811)">"There, what's that light?" he said excitedly.&#160;</p>
<a id="p812" name="p812"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(812)">When Chester replied, his voice held as much puzzlement as the robot was capable of feeling: "There is no light that I see, Dennis."&#160;</p>
<a id="p813" name="p813"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(813)">"Right over here," the youth insisted.&#160;</p>
<a id="p814" name="p814"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(814)">He plunged into the undergrowth, waddling as he forced his way through the brush that grew most thickly at the fringes of the trail. The light flickered, but it was too saturated to be merely a will-o'-the-wisp&#151;rotting wood or gas glowing as it drifted from fallen vegetation. It looked like firelight; and when it was raining like this, a fire meant there was shelter as well.&#160;</p>
<a id="p815" name="p815"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(815)">He'd half feared that the light would somehow slip away; but as Dennis fought his way onward, the orange warmth grew clear enough to have shape through the angles of tree-boles and writhing vine stems.&#160;</p>
<a id="p816" name="p816"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(816)">There was a cabin hidden here in the jungle, and a wedge of light from its fireplace glowed through its half-open door.&#160;</p>
<a id="p817" name="p817"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(817)">"Oh, thank goodness!" Dennis cried as he freed his swordhilt from the loop of vine that caught it. "I knew something would turn up!"&#160;</p>
<a id="p818" name="p818"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(818)">The cabin appeared perfectly normal, built of logs like those of the trees all around; but there was no path to the door, just tangled jungle like that through which Dennis had thrust his way. Dennis paused. "Is this...?" he began. "Ah, Chester? Who lives here?"&#160;</p>
<a id="p819" name="p819"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(819)">"I do not see that anyone lives here, Dennis," the robot replied coolly from behind him.&#160;</p>
<a id="p820" name="p820"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(820)">Dennis stepped to the door. The threshold was an axe-smoothed log. "Hello?" he called. "Hello? Is anyone here?"&#160;</p>
<a id="p821" name="p821"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(821)">The rain continued to dribble down.&#160;</p>
<a id="p822" name="p822"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(822)">Inside the cabin was a table holding a jug of cider, a pot of aromatic stew, and a single place-setting. The fire was burning brightly in a stone fireplace with a stack of additional logs ready to be added at need. In one corner stood a tall cabinet, and a bed heaped with feathered pelts waited along the wall opposite the fire.&#160;</p>
<a id="p823" name="p823"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(823)">No one answered.&#160;</p>
<a id="p824" name="p824"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(824)">"Hello?" Dennis repeated. His scabbard clacked against the door jamb as he stepped inside. He snatched at the hilt to keep the weapon from swinging&#151;and realized just too late that anyone who saw him would take the movement as a threat.&#160;</p>
<a id="p825" name="p825"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(825)">But there was no one in the cabin to see.&#160;</p>
<a id="p826" name="p826"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(826)">The fire's warmth was as close to bliss as anything this side of Paradise could be. Dennis fluffed his shirt out, shaking droplets of water onto the half-logs of the puncheon floor. He looked around.&#160;</p>
<a id="p827" name="p827"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(827)">Chester still stood outside.&#160;</p>
<a id="p828" name="p828"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(828)">"Come on in," the youth directed.&#160;</p>
<a id="p829" name="p829"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(829)">Chester neither moved nor replied.&#160;</p>
<a id="p830" name="p830"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(830)">Dennis shook his head angrily. "All right," he said. "Suit yourself. Maybe you will rust!"&#160;</p>
<a id="p831" name="p831"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(831)">He banged the door closed&#151;after checking that the leather latch-string was out so that his companion could get inside at will.&#160;</p>
<a id="p832" name="p832"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(832)">The stew smelled wonderful.&#160;</p>
<a id="p833" name="p833"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(833)">"Hello?" Dennis called again, half-heartedly; and, when the silence answered him, dipped the horn-handled spoon into the pot and tasted the stew. Carrots and onions; potatoes; and a flavorful meat that seemed to be lamb, all in a rich gravy and just at the right temperature to eat.&#160;</p>
<a id="p834" name="p834"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(834)">He'd apologize to the owner when he came home. Anyway, he'd leave half the potful for the owner.&#160;</p>
<a id="p835" name="p835"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(835)">And the owner couldn't possibly need the food more than Dennis did.&#160;</p>
<a id="p836" name="p836"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(836)">The youth unbelted his sword, leaned it against the stone fireplace, and helped himself to the stew without further ado. He remembered that he was going to leave half; but when the pot was half empty, Dennis felt as hungry as he had when he started... and after all, the food would just get cold if he left it...&#160;</p>
<a id="p837" name="p837"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(837)">The room warmed up nicely with the door closed; but as Dennis' belly filled, he began to feel the discomfort of his wet clothing. The cloth was stiffening where it faced the fire and still clammy over most of his body.&#160;</p>
<a id="p838" name="p838"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(838)">He looked at the bed. The coverlet was a single feathery skin, large enough to have clothed an ox. Dennis couldn't imagine that it came from a bird... but he couldn't imagine anything but a bird having feathers, either.&#160;</p>
<a id="p839" name="p839"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(839)">Dennis got up and stripped off his own uncomfortable clothes. He hung them over the chair which he slid nearer the fire. Then he wrapped himself in the coverlet, tossed another log on the fire, and lay down in front of it.&#160;</p>
<a id="p840" name="p840"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(840)">The feathers were soft and warm and wonderful. Enfolded in them, Dennis forgot the rain and the misery of the hours since he left Emath. Soon it would be dawn...&#160;</p>
<a id="p841" name="p841"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(841)">And soon he slept.&#160;</p>
<a id="p842" name="p842"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(842)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p843" name="p843"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(843)">&#160;</p>
