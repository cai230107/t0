<h2 class="chapter">36</h2>

<p>Men moved to let me through. Things like that happen when you
can leave someone as a good taste or foul odor in history&rsquo;s
mouth. Croaker really made the importance of the Annals an article
of faith with everyone in the Company.</p>

<p>Lady looked around. Her ordinarily impassive expression betrayed
an instant of irritation. I said, &ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re
going to be stalled here till Bucket&rsquo;s crew convince
Mogaba&rsquo;s people they&rsquo;d really rather go home and get in
out of this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was looking kind of bleak. A wind was building. It was
colder than the wind had been for days. Heavy clouds were piling up
overhead. Looked as if we were going to get some snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; Swan said. &ldquo;We need
to get down out of these rocks.&rdquo; He was not talking to me,
really. &ldquo;I hate mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too fond of cold and snow, either,&rdquo; I
said. Of Lady I asked, &ldquo;You really need to keep avoiding
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you be getting your powers back? I thought that
business in the Barrowland stripped you forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thief. Otherwise, none of your
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her entourage sneered at me, mostly because they thought that
would make points with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been dreaming again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought about that one before admitting,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so. You&rsquo;ve been looking a little
ragged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to play you have to pay the price. What about
you, Annalist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found I was reluctant to reveal anything. Especially in front
of those guys. I forced myself. &ldquo;Yeah. Something that might
have been Kina turned up in my dreams a couple times. Almost like
an intrusion from outside. I wondered if that might have been the
same time she was bothering you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That interested her. You could see the thoughts begin moving
behind her eyes, the consideration, the calculation. She told me,
&ldquo;If it happens again, note the time. If you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. How did you manage to go head-to-head
with Kina the other night and come out in one piece?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without missing a beat Lady shifted to Groghor, a language on
its last death rattle. &ldquo;That was not Kina.&rdquo; I learned
it from my grandmother, whose people had all been wiped out in the
consolidation wars that had built the Lady&rsquo;s empire. Granny
was dead and so was my mother and I had not used the tongue except
to cuss people out since I signed on with the Company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; I
sputtered. &ldquo;How could you know that
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Captain has been kind enough to have your work copied
and forwarded to me. You mentioned Groghor somewhere. I am a little
rusty. I have not spoken this language in more than a century.
Pardon my lapses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine. But why bother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister never learned the language. Nor did this bunch,
half of whom are probably spies for someone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the deal? You said that wasn&rsquo;t Kina.
Sure fooled me if it wasn&rsquo;t. Sure fit the
description.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was my beloved sister. Pretending to be Kina. I
expect she surprised Kina&rsquo;s worshippers as much as she
surprised the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Daughter of
Night had seemed happy enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can touch the real Kina, Murgen. Believe me. It&rsquo;s
why I don&rsquo;t sleep well. The real Kina is still in her trance.
She can only touch the world in dreams. And I have to stay a part
of those dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Kina is definitely real, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something that fits the bill of particulars,
Murgen. I&rsquo;m not sure that when it&rsquo;s awake it thinks of
itself as Kina or as a goddess. It does want to bring on the Year
of the Skulls. It does want to get free of its chains. But these
are just emotions I have gained from it over the years. It is far
too alien for me to know it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Old Father Tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had to think to remember the tree-god thing that had ruled
the Plain of Fear and defied her when she was still the Lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never touched that mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would your sister pretend to be Kina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never known why my sister does any of the things
she does. She has never been rational. Two does not follow One in
her scheme, nor does Three come before Four. She is capable of
spending incredible energies and vast fortunes on the execution of
a prank. She is capable of destroying cities without ever being
able to explain why. You can know what she is doing but not why or
you can know why she is doing something but not what. She was that
way when she was three years old, before anyone knew she was cursed
with the power, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe you&rsquo;re cursed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She actually smiled. When she did her beauty shone through.
&ldquo;By an insane sister, for sure. I wish I had even the
foggiest notion why she&rsquo;s just out there, doing nothing but
watching and constantly reminding us that she&rsquo;s
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reminding us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get a little tired of those damned
crows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I thought revenge was her thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that was all she wanted she would have squashed me a
long time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a stir behind me. Scores of eyes were staring at us as
everyone in earshot tried to figure out what was going on. It had
to be some secret if we were going to talk it over in a language
nobody knew.</p>

<p>Willow Swan looked like his feelings were hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said a voice from behind me.
&ldquo;The Liberator&rsquo;s compliments and would you be so good
as to get your ass on about the job he gave you? He said to suggest
that he wants the answer before sundown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not in a language no one else understood. It cheered
Swan right up. Even Lady chuckled.</p>

<p>I do believe I blushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want to pursue this
further,&rdquo; I told Lady, who did not seem thrilled by the
prospect. To the messenger, who happened to be the nephew of a
prominent Taglian general, I said, &ldquo;Just for that I think
I&rsquo;ll go do what the Old Man wants.&rdquo;</p>
