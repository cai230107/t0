<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_26"></a><b>Chapter Fourteen</b></h1>
<a id="p3016" name="p3016"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3016)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p3017" name="p3017"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3017)">There was a moment of total vertigo; the world inverted itself around me, dwindled to a pinhole through which all reality flowed, to expand vastly, whirling . . . </p>
<a id="p3018" name="p3018"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3018)">I was standing in the street, looking across at the black hulks of burned-out cars glowing with a bluish light like corpses nine days under water. I turned, saw the empty police lorries, the dead bodies in the street, the stark, leafless trees lining the avenue, the blank eyes of the houses behind them. Dzok, the soldiers, the crowd&#151;all of them had vanished in the instant that the suit's field had sprung into being&#151;or, more correctly, I had vanished from among them. Now I was alone, in the same deserted city I had seen when I awakened after my inexplicable encounter with the flaming man in the basement of Imperial Intelligence Headquarters.</p>
<a id="p3019" name="p3019"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3019)">I looked again at the clock on the church tower: the hands stood frozen at twelve twenty-five. And the clock I had seen in the office just after the encounter had read twelve-o-five. I was already too late to intercept the flaming man before he did whatever he had been there to accomplish.</p>
<a id="p3020" name="p3020"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3020)">But I wasn't too late to spy out the Hagroon position, discover where the discontinuity engine was planted, then return, lead an assault force . . . </p>
<a id="p3021" name="p3021"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3021)">There were too many variables in the situation. Action was the only cure for the hollow sensation of foredoomed failure growing in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<a id="p3022" name="p3022"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3022)">A pebble hopped suddenly, struck the toe of my shoe as I took a step. Small dust clouds rose, swirled toward my feet as I crossed the dry, crumbling soil where grass had grown only moments before. The eerie light that seemed to emanate from the ground showed me a pattern of depressions in the soil that seemed to form before my foot reached them . . . </p>
<a id="p3023" name="p3023"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3023)">I looked behind me. There were no prints to show where I had come, but a faint trail seemed to lead ahead. A curious condition, this null time . . . </p>
<a id="p3024" name="p3024"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3024)">I crossed the sidewalk, skirted a dead man lying almost on the barricade. I clambered over the burned wreck of a car, a boxy sedan with an immense spare tire strapped to the rear. There were more bodies on the other side&#151;men who had died trying to climb the wall, or who had chosen that spot to make a stand. Among them a lone Hagroon lay, the bulky body contorted in the heavy atmosphere suit, a bloody hole in the center of his chest. Someone on the Imperial side had drawn enemy blood. The thought was cheering in this scene of desolation. I went on, glanced up at the tower clock as I passed&#151;</p>
<a id="p3025" name="p3025"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3025)">The hands stood at one minute after twelve. As I watched, the minute hand jerked back, pointed straight up.</p>
<a id="p3026" name="p3026"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3026)">And suddenly I understood. Dzok's changes to the S-suit had had the desired effect of shifting me to null time. But both of us had forgotten the earlier adjustment he had made to the suit's controls&#151;the adjustment that had caused the suit to carry me in a retrograde direction, back along the temporal profile, during my trip from the jungle world. Now, with the suit activated, holding me in my unnatural state of anti-entropy, the retrograde motion had resumed. I was traveling backward through time!</p>
<a id="p3027" name="p3027"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3027)">I walked on, watching the curious behavior of objects as they impinged on the E-field of the suit, or crossed from the field to the external environment. A pebble kicked by me took up a motion, flew from the field&#151;where it resumed its natural temporal direction, sprang back, seemed to strike my foot, then dropped from play. The air around me whispered in constant turmoil as vagrant currents were caught, displaced backward in time, only to be released, with the resultant local inequalities in air pressure. I wondered how I would appear to an outside observer&#151;or if I could be seen at all. And my weapon; what effect would&#151;or <i>could</i> it have, fired in the future, dealing death in the past&#151;</p>
<a id="p3028" name="p3028"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3028)">Soundlessly, a figure backed into view around a corner two blocks away, walked briskly toward me, the feet moving back, the arms swinging&#151;like a movie in reverse. I flattened myself against a wall, watched as the walker came closer. A Hagroon! I felt my hackles rise. I flipped the slug gun into my hand, waited . . . </p>
<a id="p3029" name="p3029"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3029)">He stepped past me, kept going, his head turning as though scanning the sidewalk for signs of life&#151;but he paid no attention to me. I looked around. There were none of his fellows in sight. It was as good a time as any to make a test. I stepped boldly out, aimed the gun at his retreating chest at a distance of twenty feet, twenty-five . . . </p>
<a id="p3030" name="p3030"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3030)">There was no reaction. I was invisible to him, while he, somehow, remained visible to me. I could only assume that light rays striking me were affected by the field, their temporal progression reversed, with the effect of simply blanking them off, while normal light emanating from the scene to me . . . </p>
<a id="p3031" name="p3031"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3031)">But how could I see, with light traveling <i>away</i> from my eyes . . . </p>
<a id="p3032" name="p3032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3032)">I remembered a statement made by an Imperium Net physicist, explaining why it was possible to scan the continua through which a moving shuttle passed in an immeasurably short instant of time: "Light is a condition, not an event . . ."</p>
<a id="p3033" name="p3033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3033)">Whatever the reason, the Hagroon couldn't see me. A break for our side at last. Now to see what I could accomplish on the strength of one small advantage and whatever luck I could find along the way.</p>
<a id="p3034" name="p3034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3034)">It was half an hour's walk to the Net Garages. There were few corpses in the street along the way. Apparently the people had been caught in their beds by the attack. Those few who had been abroad had fallen back toward the barricades&#151;and died there. I passed a pair of Hagroon, walking briskly backward, then a group of a half dozen, then a column of twenty or thirty, all moving in the opposite direction from my own course, which meant that, in normal progression, they were headed for the area of the Net Garages, coming from the direction of the Imperial HQ.</p>
<a id="p3035" name="p3035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3035)">Two blocks from there, the crowd of Hagroon almost filled the street.</p>
<a id="p3036" name="p3036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3036)">Moving with the stream&#151;which seemed to part before me, to the accompaniment of perplexed looks on the Hagroon faces I glimpsed through the dark faceplates&#151;I made my way across the North Bridge, through the dim-glowing wrought-iron gates before the looming bulk of the headquarters building. The mob of Hagroon here was tight-packed, a shoving, sullen mass of near-humanity&#151;jostling their way backward through the wide doors, overflowing the gravel walks and the barren rectangles of dry dirt that were immaculately manicured flower beds in normal times. I caught a glimpse of a clock in the front of a building across the plaza&#151;eleven fifteen.</p>
<a id="p3037" name="p3037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3037)">I had moved back through time three-quarters of an hour, while thirty subjective minutes passed.</p>
<a id="p3038" name="p3038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3038)">I made my way through the streaming crowd of suited Hagroon, reached the door, slipped through into the same high-ceilinged foyer that I had left, alone, six weeks earlier. Now it was crowded with silent Hagroon masses, overseen by two heavily brassed individuals who stood on the lower steps of the flight leading to the upper floors, waving their arms and grimacing. Sound, it appeared, failed to span the interface between "normal" null time and my reversed field effect.</p>
<a id="p3039" name="p3039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3039)">The stream pressed toward a side corridor. I made my way there, reached a small door set in the hall with the sign service stair beside it&#151;</p>
<a id="p3040" name="p3040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3040)">I remembered that door. It was the one through which I had pursued the flaming man, so many weeks before. I pushed through it, felt the ghostly jostle of Hagroon bodies that seemed to slip aside an instant before I touched them, descended one flight, followed the direction of the stream of aliens along to a door&#151;the one beyond which the fiery man had turned at bay . . . </p>
<a id="p3041" name="p3041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3041)">The stream of Hagroon was smaller now, less tightly packed. I stood aside, watched as the creatures shuffled backward through the narrow entry into the small room&#151;and more and more, packing into the confined space . . . </p>
<a id="p3042" name="p3042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3042)">It wasn't possible. I had seen hundreds of the brutes in the streets, packing the entryway, crowding the corridors, all streaming here&#151;or <i>from</i> here in the normal time sequence&#151;from this one small room . . . </p>
<a id="p3043" name="p3043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3043)">There were only a few Hagroon in the hall now, standing listening to a silent harangue from a brass-spangled officer. They shuffled back, almost eagerly passed into the room. The officers appeared from above, joined in a brief huddle, backed through the door into the gloom. I followed&#151;and stopped dead.</p>
<a id="p3044" name="p3044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3044)">A glistening, ten-foot disk of insubstantiality shimmered in the air, floating an inch or two above the dull stone floor, not quite grazing the dusty beamed ceiling of the abandoned storeroom. As I watched, one of the remaining Hagroon officers backed quickly to it, crouched slightly, leaped backward through the disk&#151;and disappeared as magically as a rabbit into a magician's hat. There were only two Hagroon left now. One of them backed to the disk, hopped through. The last spoke into a small hand-held instrument, stood for a moment gazing about the room, ignoring me utterly. Then he too sprang through the disk and was gone.</p>
<a id="p3045" name="p3045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3045)">I was seeing wonders, which, by comparison, the shuttles of the Imperium were as prosaic as wicker baby buggies, but there was no time to stand in awe, gaping. This was an entry portal from some other space to null-time Stockholm. The Hagroon had entered through it; from where, I didn't know. There was a simple empirical method of answering that question . . . </p>
<a id="p3046" name="p3046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3046)">I went to the disk&#151;like the surface of a rippled pond, upended in gloom. There was another visible beyond that mysterious plane. I gritted my teeth, took an instant to hope I was guessing right, and stepped through.</p>
<a id="p3047" name="p3047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3047)">I knew at once that I was back in normal time&#151;still running backwards, doubtless, still in the same room&#151;but I was standing in honest darkness, away from the pervasive death light of null time. There were Hagroon all about me, bulky, suited figures, almost filling the confined space of the room, overflowing into the corridor, seemingly unbothered by the lack of illumination. I recognized the officers I had seen moments before, the last to pass through the portals&#151;or the first, in normal time: the pioneers sent through ahead of the main body to reconnoiter&#151;before the horde poured through, to stream back to the Net Garages. Six weeks earlier&#151;or tonight; either way of looking at it was equally valid&#151;I would meet them there, embarking in their shuttles to return to the Hagroon world line, their job here finished. But now, because of the miracle of my retrograde motion in the time stream, I was seeing the play acted out in reverse; watching the victorious troops, flushed from their victory over the sleeping city, about to back out into the streets, and re-enact their gas attack.</p>
<a id="p3048" name="p3048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3048)">Many of the Hagroon, I noted, carried heavy canisters. Others, as I watched, took empty containers from a heap in the corridor, hitched them into place on their backs. They were filing away now, by two's and three's, backing out into the corridors, up the stairs, back into the dead streets. I started to follow&#151;then checked myself. There was something tugging at the edge of my awareness. Something I must do, now&#151;quickly&#151;before my chance slipped away. Events were flowing inexorably toward their inevitable conclusion, while I hesitated, racking my brain. It was hard to think, hard to orient my thoughts in the distorted perspective of reversed time; but I had to stop now, force myself to analyze what I was seeing, reconstruct the attack.</p>
<a id="p3049" name="p3049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3049)">The Hagroon had arrived at the Net Garages. I had seen their shuttles there. It was the perfect spot for an assault in force via shuttle, and due to the characteristic emanations of the Net communicator carriers, easy to pinpoint for navigation purposes.</p>
<a id="p3050" name="p3050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3050)">Once there, they had marched across the empty null-time city to Intelligence Headquarters, a convenient central location from which to attack, and with plenty of dark cellar rooms&#151;and perhaps there was also an element of sardonic humor in their choice of staging areas . . . </p>
<a id="p3051" name="p3051"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3051)">Then the troops had poured through the portal, emerged into the midnight streets of the real-time city, spewing gas&#151;the attack the end of which I was now witnessing.</p>
<a id="p3052" name="p3052"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3052)">Then they had returned through the portal, crossed to their shuttles again in null time&#151;the exodus I had just witnessed . . . </p>
<a id="p3053" name="p3053"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3053)">But why the gas attack on a city about to suffer annihilation along with the rest of the planet?</p>
<a id="p3054" name="p3054"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3054)">Simple: The Hagroon needed peace and quiet in which to erect the discontinuity engine&#151;and they needed the assurance that the infernal machine would remain undisturbed for the necessary time to allow them to pass back through their portal into null time, regain their shuttles, and leave the doomed A-line. By gassing the city, they had ensured their tranquility while they perpetrated the murder of a universe.</p>
<a id="p3055" name="p3055"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3055)">Because it was more than a world they killed. It was a planet, a solar system, a sky filled with stars, to the ends of conceivable space and beyond&#151;a unique, irreplaceable aspect of reality, to be wiped forever from the face of the continuum, because one world, one tiny dust-mote in that universe posed a possible threat to Hagroon safety. It was an abominable plot&#151;and the moments during which I could take action to thwart it were fast slipping away. Somewhere, at this moment, a crew was at work, preparing the doomsday device. And if I delayed, even for minutes, in finding it&#151;it would be too late or (too early!). The machine would be separated into its component parts, carried away to the shuttles by backward-walking men, transported out of range&#151;</p>
<a id="p3056" name="p3056"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3056)">I had to find the engine&#151;now!</p>
<a id="p3057" name="p3057"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3057)">I looked around. Hagroon laden with empty canisters were still backing away along the corridor. Their officers waved their arms, mouths moving behind faceplates. One individual, helmetless, caught my attention. He came from the opposite direction along the narrow hall, stepping briskly up to the Hagroon directing the canister operation. Two rank-and-file Hagroon preceded him. They turned away, joined a group plucking empty canisters from a heap and fitting them on their backs. The helmetless one talked to the officer; both nodded, talked some more; then the former backed away down the dark hall&#151;away from the stair. I hesitated a moment, then followed.</p>
<a id="p3058" name="p3058"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3058)">He backed off fifty feet, turned into a storeroom much like the one in which the portal had been erected. There were four other Hagroon there, crouching around a heavy tripod on which a massive construction rested, its casing lying on the floor to one side.</p>
<a id="p3059" name="p3059"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3059)">Luck was with me. I had found the discontinuity engine.</p>
<a id="p3060" name="p3060"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3060)">The next step was clear to me in the same instant that I saw the engine. As two of the Hagroon paused, staring with comically puzzled expressions, I went to the stand, planted my feet, gripped the massive casing, and lifted. It came away easily. My slightly accelerated time rate, although reversed, gave me an added quota of brute strength. I stepped back, hugged the horror device to my chest, feeling the buzz of its timer&#151;and to my blank amazement, saw it still resting where it had been&#151;while I held its counterpart in my hands. The Hagroon technicians were working away, apparently undisturbed. But then, I hadn't yet appeared, to create paradox before their startled eyes . . . </p>
<a id="p3061" name="p3061"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3061)">I turned to the door, made my way along the corridor, climbed the steps, set off at the fastest dog trot I could manage for the Net Garages.</p>
<a id="p3062" name="p3062"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3062)">I made it in twenty minutes, in spite of the awkward burden, forcing myself to ignore the gas attack going on all around me. Suited Hagroon clumped backward through the well-lit streets under a vague cloud of brownish gas that seemed to slowly coalesce, drawing together as I watched. I half-ran, half-walked, shifting my grip on the heavy casing, sweating heavily now inside the suit. The gas was all around me, and I hoped the seals of my garment were as secure as Dzok had assured me they were.</p>
<a id="p3063" name="p3063"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3063)">At the garages, a few morose-looking Hagroon loitered about the parked shuttles, peering out through the wide doors toward the sounds of action in the city streets. I passed them unnoticed, went to the last shuttle in line&#151;the same machine I had ridden once before. I knew it had preset controls, which would automatically home it on it's A-line of origin&#151;the Hagroon world. I pulled open the door, lowered my burden to the grey metal floor, pushed it well inside, then checked the wall clock. Dzok and I had calculated that the engine had gone into action at two AM precisely. It was now ten forty-five; three hours and fifteen minutes until M minute.</p>
<a id="p3064" name="p3064"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3064)">And the transit of the shuttle from the Zero-zero line to the Hagroon line had taken three hours and twenty-five minutes.</p>
<a id="p3065" name="p3065"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3065)">I had ten minutes to kill . . . </p>
<a id="p3066" name="p3066"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3066)">The discontinuity engine was already counting down toward its moment of cataclysmic activity&#151;the titanic outpouring of energy which would release the stasis which constituted the fabric of reality for this line of alternate existence. I had plucked it from the hands of its makers just as they were completing their installation. When the time came, it would perform. The shuttle was the problem now. I climbed inside, looked over the controls. They, at least, were simple enough. A trip wire, attached to the main field switch . . . </p>
<a id="p3067" name="p3067"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3067)">I went back out, found a length of piano wire on a workbench at one side of the garage, secured it to the white painted lever that controlled the shuttle's generators, led the wire out through the door. Five minutes to go, now. It was important to get the timing as exact as possible. I watched the hands of the clock move back: ten thirty-four; ten thirty-three; ten thirty-two; ten thirty-one. There was a faint vibration from the shuttle . . . </p>
<a id="p3068" name="p3068"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3068)">I closed the door carefully, checked to be sure the wire was clear, then gripped it, gave it a firm pull. The shuttle seemed to waver. It shimmered, winked for an instant&#151;then sat, solid and secure, unmoving. I let out a breath; the example of the engine had forewarned me. The results of my actions on external objects weren't visible to me, but I had sent the shuttle on its way. This was its past reality I saw before me now.</p>
<a id="p3069" name="p3069"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3069)">&#160;</p>
