<h2 class="chapter">43</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> don&rsquo;t know
what to do with myself, not having to work,&rdquo; Sahra told me.
She and Tobo were huddled in front of the mist box, sharing what
they could with Murgen. I was pleased to see mother and son getting
along.</p>

<p>I suggested, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always work for those who want
to put out the buttons that&rsquo;ll remind everyone about us after
we&rsquo;re gone. There&rsquo;s always something that needs lugging
down to the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To paraphrase Goblin, I don&rsquo;t miss work so much
I&rsquo;m actually going to volunteer to do some. Was there
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guys just brought in Singh&rsquo;s son. Good-looking
fellow. They also brought in a couple of rescripts they found
posted on the official announcement pillars. Put up since the
Radisha went into seclusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainly that she&rsquo;s willing to pay some pretty big
rewards for information leading to the apprehension of any member
of the gang of vandals masquerading as members of the long defunct
Black Company and causing public disorders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will anybody believe that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she says it often enough. I don&rsquo;t care about her
telling tall tales. I care about the reward offers. There&rsquo;re
people out there who&rsquo;d sell their mothers. She puts a couple
of no-goods on the street throwing money around and bragging about
how they cashed in, somebody who really knows something might
decide to bet the long odds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we just go? There isn&rsquo;t that
much more we can do here anyway, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can get Mogaba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the world think that. Start a rumor. Start a bunch of
rumors about the Great General <em>and</em> about the Radisha. While we
evacuate. When are you leaving to get the Key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Soon. I&rsquo;m stalling for time. So
a message can get through to Slink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sahra nodded. She smiled. &ldquo;Good thinking. Singh will have
something up his sleeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willow Swan suddenly invited himself to join us. &ldquo;The girl
is having some kind of a problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I scowled at him. Sahra did the same but was polite enough to
ask, &ldquo;The Daughter of Night? What kind of problem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s having a fit. A seizure,
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect timing,&rdquo; I grumbled. At the same time,
Sahra yelled for Tobo to get Goblin. I growled, &ldquo;What were
you doing anywhere near her, Swan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He showed some color and said,
&ldquo;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, you dumb mudsucker! Lady did you in. You panted after
her for years. Then you put the screws to a dozen million people by
letting Lady&rsquo;s baby sister threaten to blow in your ear. Now
you&rsquo;re going to let Lady&rsquo;s brat put a ring in your nose
and make an even bigger idiot out of you? You really are stupid and
pathetic, Swan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking with something that isn&rsquo;t your brain. As
though you&rsquo;re some dopey fifteen-year-old. This woman
isn&rsquo;t some cute little virgin, Swan! She&rsquo;s worse than
your worst nightmare. Come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came. I moved suddenly, violently, the way I had wanted to do
so many times with my uncles. The tip of my dagger penetrated the
skin underneath his chin. &ldquo;You really want to die a really
stupid, humiliating, pointless death? Let me know. I&rsquo;ll
arrange it. Without the rest of us having to pay the price
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One-Eye&rsquo;s cackle filled the air. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a
wonder, Swan? You ought to think about her instead of your usual
black widows.&rdquo; He was in Do Trang&rsquo;s spare wheelchair
again but getting around under his own power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could arrange something pointless and humiliating for
you, too, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He just laughed at me. &ldquo;You invited this soldier Aridatha
down here to meet his long-lost daddy, Sleepy. You ought to be
dealing with him instead of here flirting with Swan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could be maddening at times. And he loved it. If he could
find any kind of lever at all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I told
Swan, &ldquo;You explain to One-Eye what you mean about the girl.
One-Eye, deal with it. Solve it. Short of killing her. Singh
won&rsquo;t give me the Key if we kill the skinny
little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;witch.&rdquo;</p>
