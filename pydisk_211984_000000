<p>Oar is the city nearest the old battleground and burying place
called the Barrowland. The alarm cried by the fetish there touched
two residents.</p>

<p>One was an old, old man living incognito because he had
contrived to stage his apparent death during the struggle that had
devastated the Barrowland. The alarm struck him as he sat guzzling
in a workingman&rsquo;s tavern with new cronies who thought him an
astrologer. When it hit him he knew a moment of panic. Then, tears
streaming, he rushed into the street.</p>

<p>A questioning babble arose behind him. When his comrades came
out to learn what was wrong he had vanished.</p>
