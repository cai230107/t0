  <p>&#8220;Even you have to admit that he&#8217;s doing well,&#8221; Izzy said. They were back in her office, and she was peering at Mordi from behind her desk.</p>
  <p>Mordi set his jaw. He didn&#8217;t have to admit anything of the sort. &#8220;If by &#8216;doing well&#8217; you mean that he&#8217;s managed to convince you that black is white and up is down, then, yeah. He&#8217;s doing remarkably well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Jumping Jupiter, Mordi,&#8221; she said, one hand gesturing toward Hieronymous. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do nothing but the simplest of tasks,&#8221; Mordi finished.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s saved mortals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;<em>Mortals</em>. You remember them? That species that you say he can&#8217;t stand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t,&#8221; Mordi said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then why&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I. Don&#8217;t. Know.&#8221; And not knowing was driving him crazy. &#8220;But he&#8217;s up to something.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re paranoid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not paranoia if everyone really is after you.&#8221; Mighty Zeus, he was reduced to talking in bumper stickers. The woman had a way of breaking down his defenses and tying his tongue. He wanted to shake some sense into her. Better yet, he wanted to kiss her so hard and so thoroughly that she finally understood. She said she could feel that Hieronymous was sincere? Well, maybe she thought she could, but he&#8217;d show her just how sincere <em>he</em> was. And then he&#8217;d see what she said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mordi?&#8221;</p>
  <p>
   <em>Oh, heck</em>. He drew in a breath, looking at her warily. Did she know what he was thinking? <em>Of course she does, you idiot. She&#8217;s an empath</em>.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t read me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re working together. It&#8217;s not appropriate for you to get into my head.&#8221; His words came out measured and strong, without a hint of embarrassment. Inside his head, he was kicking himself, mortification rolling off of him in huge waves.</p>
  <p>The look she flashed him was one of pure disdain. &#8220;Read you? Don&#8217;t flatter yourself. And besides, I can&#8217;t read you without touching you. All I can tell by being near you is what you&#8217;re feeling.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maybe she was trying to make him feel better, but suddenly he felt totally exposed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; he snapped, the word coming out harsher than he intended.</p>
  <p>Something akin to pain flashed in her eyes, but then the mask fell back into place and she was the perfect professional again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have no reason to read you, Mordi. None at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Despite the ice in her words, they cut through him like a hot knife. &#8220;Good,&#8221; Mordi said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep it that way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
  <p>He sat there a moment, fuming and feeling foolish, then stood to leave half-hoping she&#8217;d stop him. She didn&#8217;t, and her silence cut through him as much as her sharp words had.</p>
  <p>He went to her door, opened it, then stepped out into the hallway. And as soon as the door closed behind him, he leaned back against the wall and took a single deep breath.</p>
  <p>He should be satisfied. She was agreeing to stay out of his head and away from his emotions. And yet he wasn&#8217;t satisfied. Not at all.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Typical</em>. His whole life he&#8217;d always wanted to be closer to the people who pushed him away. His mother, his father. And now this woman.</p>
  <p>
   <em>Mordi, you&#8217;re pathetic. Just do your job and get the hell away from her.</em>
  </p>
  <p>And that, he thought, was very sound advice.</p>
