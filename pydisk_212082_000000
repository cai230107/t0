<h2 class="chapter">47</h2>

<p>I was snoring heroically down deep in our warrens, having gone
to Nod confident I could sleep in. Tomorrow nobody would have the
ambition to get up to any mischief.</p>

<p>I was down there so far and so far out of the way that not five
people knew where to find me. I was on a mission to catch up on my
sleep. If the end of the world came the guys could celebrate
without me.</p>

<p>Somebody shook me.</p>

<p>I refused to believe it. It had to be a bad dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murgen. Come on. You got to come see this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murgen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cracked an eyelid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get some sleep
here, Bucket. Go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got time. You got to come see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got to come see what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There would be no winning this. He would pester me till I lost
my temper, then get his feelings hurt. But the long climb to the
sunshine was not an inducement to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. All right.&rdquo; I got up and got myself
together.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t need to drag me out but I understood the
impulse. Things had changed. Radically.</p>

<p>I stared at the plain, mouth open. Only, what plain? Dejagore
was surrounded by a shallow lake that featured the tops of burial
mounds as small islands. Each mound boasted its handful of
disconsolate animals. &ldquo;How deep is it?&rdquo; I asked. And,
&ldquo;There any chance we can catch some of those critters for the
pot?&rdquo; With all that water down there no southerner would be
guarding against sorties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now, five feet,&rdquo; Goblin said. &ldquo;I had
men go down and measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it still coming up? Where is it coming from? Where is
Shadowspinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goblin pointed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Spinner, but
there&rsquo;s the water. Still coming in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have good eyes. I made out the water boiling and foaming as it
roared out of the hills. &ldquo;The old aqueduct came down there,
didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Two major canals had irrigated the hill
farms and fed aqueducts to Dejagore before the fighting started.
The Company cut those when the southerners were on the inside. Now
the city survived on rainwater and the contents of large, deep,
very stagnant cisterns we knew nothing about back then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Clete and his brothers figure they diverted the
entire river into the canal. Same thing south of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dejagore sits on a plain below the level of the country beyond
the hills. Modest rivers run both west and southeast of the
hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume the boys are studying the engineering
aspects?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them and three dozen Taglians who had some skills the
guys could use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any conclusions yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like how high will the water get? Are we going to
drown?&rdquo; If that was Shadowspinner&rsquo;s plan it indicated
major changes in his thinking. Before, he wanted Dejagore recovered
intact. This seemed a more practical and final answer to his
problems, though more destructive of property&mdash;which, of course, was
more valuable than any number of lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to figure that out right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grunted. &ldquo;I take it Spinner pulled out after Lady
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; One-Eye responded. &ldquo;They hung
around to swim. They don&rsquo;t get to a lot of beach parties
where they come from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s not as stupid as we
thought,&rdquo; I mused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He floods the plain, even if he don&rsquo;t drown us he
locks us up so tight he don&rsquo;t have to use hardly any men to
keep us under control. He can chase Lady all he wants. We
can&rsquo;t help her and she can&rsquo;t help us. For him
it&rsquo;s better than getting reinforcements out of the
Shadowlands. Longshadow&rsquo;s soldiers couldn&rsquo;t be trusted
behind his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thai Dei showed up. He always turned up soon after I came out,
which indicated how closely we were being watched.</p>

<p>Thai Dei was a waste of manpower. He didn&rsquo;t carry many
messages. He didn&rsquo;t understand any of our languages well
enough to be a good spy for the Speaker. But he was always, always
just a few steps away.</p>

<p>There would be a reason. The Speaker would do nothing without
consideration. I just did not grasp his view of the world.</p>

<p>The longer I stared at the flood the more questions I came up
with that needed answers soon. Most critical? How high would the
water rise? How long would it take to do so? The rate of rise would
slow down substantially as each vertical foot required more water
volume because of the fall back of the hills, evaporation from the
larger surface area, and absorption by more covered soil.</p>

<p>I told Goblin and One-Eye, &ldquo;Dig up every educated man in
town and give him to the brothers.&rdquo; I thought about building
boats and heightening towers and securing stores. I thought about
our vast and wonderful warrens and the likelihood that thousands of
manhours would go for naught. I thought about how we would have to
prepare ourselves mentally for lots worse if we were going to
survive. I thought about Ky Dam and his talk of hard times to
come.</p>

<p>Thai Dei stepped over when nobody else was near.
&ldquo;Grandfather would speak with you. Soon, if possible.&rdquo;
His manners were impeccable. He did not call me Stone Soldier even
once.</p>

<p>The old man must want something badly. &ldquo;As you
wish.&rdquo; I noticed the outsider Sindhu on the battlements off
toward the Western gate. I could feel him watching me.
&ldquo;One-Eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to bark. If you want to bark
I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t have the Shadowmaster turn you into
a dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One-Eye was startled. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guys keeping an eye on our guest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geek and Freak are taking turns. He ain&rsquo;t done much
yet. Wandered around town. Talked to people. Tried visiting with
the Taglians, here and over with Mogaba. Ours wouldn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with him. The al-Khul Company ran him off with their
swords drawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would anybody talk about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One-Eye shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same old shit.
Maybe even worse. You better make it clear him being here
wasn&rsquo;t your idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thai Dei, listening, murmured something that sounded cabalistic.
He followed with a gesture resembling that meant to avert the evil
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; One-Eye said. &ldquo;Something can bother
these guys after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go listen to their boss talk.
You&rsquo;re in charge, but only because everybody else around here
is less trustworthy than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks a shitload, Kid. You make a guy feel like
he&rsquo;s on top of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to have something left when I get back.&rdquo;</p>
