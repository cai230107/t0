<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_21"></a><b>CHAPTER 21&#160;</b></h1>
<a id="p1174" name="p1174"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1174)" align="center">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1175" name="p1175"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1175)">In the evening, the sky darkened again before sunset. The needlepoint patches of blue became pools of roiling cloud.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1176" name="p1176"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1176)">"He who runs abroad from evil, finds evil where he flees," Chester said.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1177" name="p1177"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1177)">Dennis laughed and patted the robot's carapace. The cut across his palm still stung, and there seemed to be a little swelling in the hand itself. Despite that, he felt surprisingly good. "But can the wanderer find shelter from the rain, my friend?" he asked.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1178" name="p1178"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1178)">Chester rose cautiously onto the tips of his eight tentacles. Even so, the robot's egg-shaped body was no higher than Dennis' shoulders. Chester rotated slowly, moving his limbs in sets of four, a few inches clockwise at a time.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1179" name="p1179"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1179)">At last he said, "Here is a tree that became hollow before it fell, Dennis. It will give us shelter from the rain."&#160;</p>
<a id="p1180" name="p1180"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1180)">Dennis couldn't imagine how his companion could see a fallen tree or anything else through the leaves and gathering darkness, but he followed Chester willingly into the undergrowth. A few yards away&#151;though each step was a battle&#151;was the bole of a forest giant, just as the robot had said.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1181" name="p1181"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1181)">Upright, the tree had been twenty feet across at the base. Now, on its side, more than half that diameter was a cave whose lip was orange and yellow with the shelf fungus eating its way into the wood which remained.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1182" name="p1182"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1182)">Chester paused. The first drops of rain rapped against leaves, but the downpour hadn't yet penetrated the triple canopy.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1183" name="p1183"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1183)">Dennis climbed in. The interior of the trunk was damp and had a hint of reptilian sharpness. It made him wish that he'd drawn the sword before entering. Chester followed, a barely-visible glimmer in silhouette as the storm thundered down and washed away the last of the daylight.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1184" name="p1184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1184)">The hollow was slimy, and Dennis could hear water running through a knothole somewhere farther back in the trunk; but in comparison at least to the night before, he was dry and comfortable. The tree was real, not a dream like the dead wizard's cabin, and Chester lay beside him with his limbs coiled.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1185" name="p1185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1185)">Dennis laughed. "How is it that heroes spend the nights between one adventure and the next, Chester," he asked.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1186" name="p1186"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1186)">"You are a hero, Dennis," the robot said softly. "And it is in a fallen tree that you are spending the night."&#160;</p>
<a id="p1187" name="p1187"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1187)">"I'm no hero," the youth murmured. "I know that now."&#160;</p>
<a id="p1188" name="p1188"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1188)">But he slept easily, wrapped in the fuzzy warmth of his friend's compliment.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1189" name="p1189"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1189)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1190" name="p1190"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1190)">&#160;</p>
