<h2 class="chapter">22</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Master
Santaraksita wanted to know why I was late, I told the truth.
&ldquo;Another Bhodi disciple set himself on fire in front of the
Palace. I went to watch. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. There was
sorcery involved.&rdquo; I described what I had seen. As so many of
the actual eyewitnesses also had, Santaraksita seemed both repelled
and intrigued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose those disciples are doing that,
Dorabee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew why they were doing it. It took no genius to fathom their
motives. Only their determination remained a puzzle.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to tell the Radisha that she&rsquo;s
not fulfilling her obligations to the Taglian people. They consider
the situation so desperate that they&rsquo;ve chosen to send their
message by a means that can&rsquo;t be ignored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, believe that to be the case. The question
remains: What can the Radisha <em>do</em>? The Protector won&rsquo;t go away
just because some people believe she&rsquo;s bad for
Taglios.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a great deal to do today, Sri, and I&rsquo;m
starting late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go. Go. I must assemble the bhadrhalok. It&rsquo;s
possible we can present the Radisha with some means of shaking the
Protector&rsquo;s grip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Sri.&rdquo; He would need it. Only the most
outrageous good luck since the beginning of time was going to give
him and his cronies the tools to undo Soulcatcher. Chances were
good the bhadrhalok had no idea how dangerous an opponent they had
chosen.</p>

<p>I dusted and mopped and checked the rodent traps and after a
while noticed that most everyone had gone away. I asked old
Baladitya the copyist where everyone was. He told me that the other
copyists had ducked out as soon as the senior librarians had gone
off to their bhadrhalok meeting. They knew that the bhadrhalok
would do nothing but it would take them hours of grumbling and
talking and arguing to get it done, so they made themselves a
holiday.</p>

<p>It was not an opportunity to be refused. I began examining
books, even going so far as to penetrate the restricted stacks.
Baladitya knew nothing. He could not see three feet in front of his
face.</p>
