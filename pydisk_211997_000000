<h2 class="chapter">Chapter One: THE CROSSROADS</h2>

<p>We seven remained at the crossroads, watching the dust from the
eastern way. Even irrepressible One-Eye and Goblin were stricken by
the finality of the hour. Otto&rsquo;s horse whickered. He closed
her nostrils with one hand, patted her neck with the other,
quieting her. It was a time for contemplation, the final emotional
milemark of an era.</p>

<p>Then there was no more dust. They were gone. Birds began to
sing, so still did we remain. I took an old notebook from my
saddlebag, settled in the road. In a shaky hand I wrote: <em>The end
has come. The parting is done. Silent, Darling, and the Torque
brothers have taken the road to Lords. The Black Company is no
more</em>.</p>

<p>Yet I will continue to keep the Annals, if only because a habit
of twenty-five years is so hard to break. And, who knows? Those to
whom I am obliged to carry them may find the account interesting.
The heart is stilled but the corpse stumbles on. The Company is
dead in fact but not in name.</p>

<p>And we, O merciless gods, stand witness to the power of
names.</p>

<p>I replaced the book in my saddlebag. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
that.&rdquo; I swatted the dust off the back of my lap, peered down
our own road into tomorrow. A low line of greening hills formed a
fencerow over which sheeplike tufts began to bound. &ldquo;The
quest begins. We have time to cover the first dozen
miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That would leave only seven or eight thousand more.</p>

<p>I surveyed my companions.</p>

<p>One-Eye was the oldest by a century, a wizard, wrinkled and
black as a dusty prune. He wore an eyepatch and a floppy, battered
black felt hat. That hat seemed to suffer every conceivable
misfortune, yet survived every indignity.</p>

<p>Likewise Otto, a very ordinary man. He had been wounded a
hundred times and had survived. He almost believed himself favored
of the gods.</p>

<p>Otto&rsquo;s sidekick was Hagop, another man with no special
color. But another survivor. My glance surprised a tear.</p>

<p>Then there was Goblin. What is there to say of Goblin? The name
says it all, and yet nothing? He was another wizard, small, feisty,
forever at odds with One-Eye, without whose enmity he would curl up
and die. He was the inventor of the frog-faced grin.</p>

<p>We five have been together twenty-some years. We have grown old
together. Perhaps we know one another too well. We form limbs of a
dying organism. Last of a mighty, magnificent, storied line. I fear
we, who look more like bandits than the best soldiers in the world,
denigrate the memory of the Black Company.</p>

<p>Two more. Murgen, whom One-Eye sometimes calls Pup, was
twenty-eight. The youngest. He joined the Company after our
defection from the empire. He was a quiet man of many sorrows,
unspoken, with no one and nothing but the Company to call his own,
yet an outsider and lonely man even here.</p>

<p>As are we all. As are we all.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was Lady, who used to be <em>the</em> Lady. Lost Lady,
beautiful Lady, my fantasy, my terror, more silent than Murgen, but
from a different cause: despair. Once she had it all. She gave it
up. Now she has nothing.</p>

<p>Nothing she knows to be of value.</p>

<p>That dust on the Lords road was gone, scattered by a chilly
breeze. Some of my beloved had departed my life forever.</p>

<p>No sense staying around. &ldquo;Cinch them up,&rdquo; I said,
and set an example. I tested the ties on the pack animals.
&ldquo;Mount up. One-Eye, you take the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, a hint of spirit as Goblin carped, &ldquo;I have to eat
his dust?&rdquo; If One-Eye had point that meant Goblin had
rearguard. As wizards they were no mountain movers, but they were
useful. One fore and one aft left me feeling far more
comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About his turn, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things like that don&rsquo;t deserve a turn,&rdquo;
Goblin said. He tried to giggle but only managed a smile that was a
ghost of his usual toadlike grin.</p>

<p>One-Eye&rsquo;s answering glower was not much pumpkin, either.
He rode out without comment.</p>

<p>Murgen followed fifty yards behind, a twelve-foot lance rigidly
upright. Once that lance had flaunted our standard. Now it trailed
four feet of tattered black cloth. The symbolism lay on several
levels.</p>

<p>We knew who we were. It was best that others did not. The
Company had too many enemies.</p>

<p>Hagop and Otto followed Murgen, leading pack animals. Then came
Lady and I, also with tethers behind. Goblin trailed us by seventy
yards. And thus we always traveled for we were at war with the
world. Or maybe it was the other way around.</p>

<p>I might have wished for outriders and scouts, but there was a
limit to what seven could accomplish. Two wizards were the next
best thing.</p>

<p>We bristled with weaponry. I hoped we looked as easy as a
hedgehog does to a fox.</p>

<p>The eastbound road dropped out of sight. I was the only one to
look back in hopes Silent had found a vacancy in his heart. But
that was a vain fantasy. And I knew it.</p>

<p>In emotional terms we had parted ways with Silent and Darling
months ago, on the blood-sodden, hate-drenched battleground of the
Barrowland.</p>

<p>A world was saved there, and so much else lost. We will live out
our lives wondering about the cost.</p>

<p>Different hearts, different roads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like rain, Croaker,&rdquo; Lady said.</p>

<p>Her remark startled me. Not that what she said was not true. It
did look like rain. But it was the first observation she had
volunteered since that dire day in the north.</p>

<p>Maybe she was going to come around.</p>
