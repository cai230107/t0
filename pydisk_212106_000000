<h2 class="chapter">68</h2>

<p>It started like a well-rehearsed play where Mogaba&rsquo;s
characters were desperate to please their audience. The rioting,
that is. Uncle Doj and I formed work parties to take advantage. We
got into the storage chambers without challenge, ten Old Crew and
ten Nyueng Bao. We started dragging off sacks of rice and flour,
sugar and beans. The riots were nasty from the start. They swamped
the whole southern half of Dejagore. Every man Mogaba controlled
was out there helping crush the rebellion. And every Jaicuri man
and boy seemed to want to get at the Nar, even if they had to
exterminate the whole First Legion to reach them.</p>

<p>My people went on the alert, established in strong positions,
long before nightfall. Likewise the Nyueng Bao, who had no
immediate trouble. We ambushed one mob. A shower of missiles from
front, sides, and above swiftly changed their minds.</p>

<p>Mogaba&rsquo;s men had more problems. They were not ready.
Worse, they were scattered, often in isolated work parties and
patrols.</p>

<p>For a while everybody joked and cracked wise and speculated on
Mogaba&rsquo;s first words after the fighting ended and he found
his cellars plundered.</p>

<p>I ran into Bucket my second trip back. &ldquo;Beans,&rdquo; I
told him, dropping a huge sack. &ldquo;The change of diet will do
us good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real bloody out there this time, Murgen.
Mogaba has asked for support twice. We told him we couldn&rsquo;t
find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep on not being able. Unless it looks like we
would end up worse off if we didn&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not likely. He has most of the weapons. His
men have been throwing people off the wall by the hundreds, just
anybody, whether or not they&rsquo;re rebelling, men, women and
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mogaba&rsquo;s way. What about those
fires?&rdquo; There were a few. Whenever there is disorder somebody
starts burning things down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re burning themselves out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is going fine, then. But keep an eye
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went back to my looting happy as the proverbial clam. This
might be the end of Mogaba as a royal pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj caught me in the storage chamber later. &ldquo;Some
Taglian soldiers are abandoning their posts for the safety of the
citadel. If we continue this raiding we will get caught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. If we don&rsquo;t get spotted Mogaba will blame it
on natives who knew about the passageways.&rdquo; This raid was
going to cost us our opportunity to spy on any more staff
meetings.</p>

<p>It was worth it.</p>

<p>Would I feel the same way tomorrow, when Mogaba began looking
for his stores? When I had a full belly?</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a small problem, Standardbearer,&rdquo; Uncle
Doj said a while later. Each of us staggered under a last sack of
rice. We were the last brigands out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;News of our success is sure to leak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Only a few people know. It&rsquo;s in all their
interests to stay clammed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone talked about what I showed you
earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dark ceremonies. Someone talked. The rumors sparked
tonight&rsquo;s riots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that. They were too
organized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an organized cadre, naturally, but this
uprising was more widespread. It is also out of control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo; He had spent his evening with
me. He had had no chance to observe any riots.</p>

<p>Before he could respond Thai Dei popped out of the darkness. He
gobbled away, becoming too animated for the space. If he killed my
candle I was going to choke him. As soon as I found him.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black men are trying to break open the north gate and
flood the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re what?&rdquo; That would take care of the
riots, all right. But not even Mogaba would go that far. Would
he?</p>

<p>Uncle Doj and I did our best to run carrying sacks of rice. I
bet we looked silly.</p>
