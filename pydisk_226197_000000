<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_75"></a><b>Chapter 75</b></h1>
<a id="p5457" name="p5457"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5457)">Benito had stripped down to match the slaves. The poor devils had nothing more than breeches, which mean that the Shetland knife, the three files, spare knives, and the manacle key had to be strapped to his legs. His body, face and the breeches were suitably covered in mud. His medal from the Hypatians he attached to the belt-line.</p>
<a id="p5458" name="p5458"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5458)">"If you're due a saltcellar, I'll have Manfred fly the Knots banner from the inner wall, north tower," whispered Benito in parting.</p>
<a id="p5459" name="p5459"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5459)">And then he was on his own. In what, he reluctantly admitted, were still his two favorite elements: darkness and danger.</p>
<a id="p5460" name="p5460"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5460)">Moving along the backs of the tent lines, once he'd dodged the initial sentries, was tricky. There were guy-ropes, and, on one occasion a soldier relieving himself. He moved silently, manacles bundled in sackcloth and on his back, closer and closer to his target.</p>
<a id="p5461" name="p5461"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5461)">At last he only had the palisade between him and the slaves. He lay there, trying not to shiver, and watched and waited, studying the movements of the guards. When he was satisfied at last, he took the moment and went up and over the eight-foot palisade like a chimney-rat under whom the fire has just been lit. Then he dropped, gently, from his full arms' stretch. This was the worrying part. There might be stakes or anything there.</p>
<a id="p5462" name="p5462"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5462)">He landed on something bony that swore at him in Greek. It was the one thing he'd learned reasonably well from Taki, Spiro and Kosti. As Spiro had explained, it wasn't that fishermen were crudely spoken. It was the fish. Fish don't understand otherwise.</p>
<a id="p5463" name="p5463"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5463)">"Shut up!" he hissed, in his now-passable Greek. "I've come to help you get out of here." Which was true, up to a point.</p>
<a id="p5464" name="p5464"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5464)">Sometime later, firmly manacled into the line, Benito lay among the huddled-together-for-warmth prisoners and pondered what he now knew. The prisoners had no idea which place they'd be working in next. There were, in toto, seven strings of twenty. The guards came and took chainfuls at a time. There were several strings out now. The prisoners&#151;naturally&#151;had wanted to escape immediately. Another day or night working meant a very real chance of dying. Benito had his work cut out to persuade them to let him chance getting to the Citadel wall.</p>
<a id="p5465" name="p5465"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5465)">His bait, however, was irresistible.</p>
<a id="p5466" name="p5466"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5466)">"Look&#151;just running, you've got maybe one chance in a hundred. But the resistance fighters out there, the <i>klepthes</i>"&#151;which meant bandits, but to the Greeks the two were remarkably close&#151;"they'll be waiting for my signal from inside the fort. The night they get it, they'll do two things. First, they want to raid one of the outposts to the south. Second there'll be some, with horses and donkeys, near the ridge with the holm-oaks. You get up there, yell 'Kalimera,' and they'll try to get you away."</p>
<a id="p5467" name="p5467"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5467)">In the meanwhile, they took turns filing their manacle chains the better part of the way through. The new-cut metal would be plastered with dust and urine. If the opportunity arose, they'd probably be able to force them.</p>
<a id="p5468" name="p5468"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5468)">Morning came. Benito found himself sent to be part of a bucket-chain, passing earth out of one of the mines. His one worry now was that he was just that much stronger, better fed and less exhausted than his Corfiote companions. He hoped the bored, brutal guards wouldn't notice.</p>
<a id="p5469" name="p5469"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5469)">During that long, hot session one of the slaves died. The guards took him out of the chain by the simple expedient of chopping his foot off. "At least he was dead," whispered the man next to him. "Zikos was alive when they did it." And the mines were considered a lucky option.</p>
<a id="p5470" name="p5470"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5470)">That afternoon, Benito quietly swapped chains. "They've been in all day. They're bound to go out tonight to work on the causeway."</p>
<a id="p5471" name="p5471"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5471)">They did. The wrong one. He had to wait until the next night.</p>
<a id="p5472" name="p5472"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5472)">Benito no longer had to fake looking exhausted, hauling rocks and broken masonry to make walls for the troops to advance behind. They had hide shields to work behind, but these were poor protection against even arquebus fire. The guards stayed well back behind some sandbags. It was simplicity itself to slip his manacle and lie down when cannon fire made the guards pull their heads down. Then it was merely a quick wriggle and squirm through a gap and a scraping slide into the water. All too easy.</p>
<a id="p5473" name="p5473"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5473)">The water wasn't. It wasn't that cold, but it was still something of a shock. Benito began to ease his way, swimming very quietly next to the edge of the mole, so that his head, if anyone saw it, might be thought part of the stone fallen from it. The siege engineers had been using broken masonry from the town and there were any number of odd-shaped bits in the water.</p>
<a id="p5474" name="p5474"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5474)">Then, flipping onto his back, he began swimming away from the mole down the channel toward the sea. Oh, to be one of the merpeople! That thought put another into his mind: the creature that the merpeople said had been haunting the Adriatic. Benito decided maybe it would be a good idea to swim with his knife in hand. After all, it was dark and still here in the water.</p>
<a id="p5475" name="p5475"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5475)">When Benito's legs touched something moving in the water, he very nearly screamed. He would have if he hadn't swallowed water in his fright. Trying not to cough, he touched it again. It was a rope. A moving rope. Moving slowly toward the Citadel shore. Benito realized it sloped gently down. Someone was hauling something across&#151;something quite heavy.</p>
<a id="p5476" name="p5476"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5476)">It almost certainly meant no good.</p>
<a id="p5477" name="p5477"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5477)">Benito swam in toward the Citadel, angling away from the rope. The rope was actually dragging something around to the south side. The shingle strip was very narrow here, and the original rock made up part of the corner tower. Benito eased out of the water, with that feeling in the middle of his back that he was in some arquebusier's sights.</p>
<a id="p5478" name="p5478"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5478)">The Citadel's builders had chopped and polished at the rock here so that the lower section was smooth. It did overhang slightly, though, and this brought Benito to where the load was being hauled. It wasn't a cave so much as another small overhang, also part of the original rock. Two men were straining to slowly pull something out of the shallows. It was plainly heavy. There was no way past, and besides, Benito had a feeling it might be more important than the mere news that Venice was on her way.</p>
<a id="p5479" name="p5479"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5479)">He waited, knife in hand, and watched. The moon was down and there was little light to see it all by. Just enough to see that the men were taking strain pulling the heavy weight up the beach.</p>
<a id="p5480" name="p5480"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5480)">The wind was cold and biting on his wet skin and wet breeches. Starting to shiver, Benito knew it was now or never. Two to one&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and they might have swords or guns.</p>
<a id="p5481" name="p5481"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5481)">The first man was so intent on pulling he died without even knowing Benito was there. The second turned and managed to grab Benito's hand and draw his own blade. Benito had to seize his arm with his left. In the dark beneath the wall they wrestled desperately in absolute silence. The fellow was as strong as an ox. He was good eight inches taller and seventy pounds heavier than Benito. By sheer weight he was pushing Benito over.</p>
<a id="p5482" name="p5482"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5482)">What was it that Erik had said? "Use their strength. Get them off balance." Benito tried to foot-sweep the man. It was a dismal failure. Instead, Benito was thrown to the shingle and cobbles, and lost the knife. The Hungarian came diving in for the kill. Benito rolled and hit the fellow just behind the ear with a cobblestone-sized rock.</p>
<a id="p5483" name="p5483"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5483)">He hit him twice more. And then put some of the rope to good use, as well as the man's trousers as a gag.</p>
<a id="p5484" name="p5484"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5484)">Then he felt around and found the Shetland knife. Now to see what they'd been doing.</p>
<a id="p5485" name="p5485"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5485)">It was barrels! There were already five in the back of the overhang and they'd plainly been surreptitiously drilling into the limestone. Benito was no engineer. Would the explosion have damaged the wall? He had no idea. But the barrels were a great deal easier to roll than to drag. He rolled them out toward where the latest one lay. All but one. That he pried at with the Hungarian's knife. He wasn't breaking his own! He liked that knife.</p>
<a id="p5486" name="p5486"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5486)">The barrel was full of powder. Black gunpowder, by the smell of it. Benito wished he had some way of striking a light&#151;once he was a bit further away. He then had the bright idea of searching his captive and found a flint and steel. Now all he needed was a gunpowder trail and he'd have fireworks to celebrate his return home. Taking double handfuls of the stuff he crept along the wall strewing it. He made a line out to the barrels and put a pile of it against them. The only trouble was, of course, that he couldn't see what he'd done.</p>
<a id="p5487" name="p5487"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5487)">Still, he decided he'd used enough. Then it was lug the semiconscious prisoner&#151;well, drag the prisoner&#151;close to the postern. Benito looked longingly at it. It would be so nice and so easy just to go and knock on it now. But they'd probably shoot him first.</p>
<a id="p5488" name="p5488"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5488)">In the shadow of wall just short of the postern, Benito struck sparks into the powder trail he'd laid. It burned. It burned damned <i>fast</i>. Benito threw caution to the wind, dropped the striker and ran, jinking, farther away from the Hungarian lines, running eastward along the beach parallel to the wall. Running, there was a good chance the sentries on the wall would see him. If they saw him, they'd shoot at him first and ask questions later. On the other hand if he continued his slow progress, he'd either be blown up by his own sabotage, or spotted and shot in the aftermath of the excitement the explosion would cause. The shingle stopped, if he recalled right, and the cliff took over just beyond that.</p>
<a id="p5489" name="p5489"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5489)">There was a yell and a shot from above. Benito tried very hard to be small, and dove into the water. Water wasn't a wall or a sandbag but it deflected bullets. He was going to stay underwater as long as possible, and swim as far and as deep as possible, and not spend more time on the surface than he had to.</p>
<a id="p5490" name="p5490"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5490)">He came up in time to hear an explosion, but not the huge one he'd been expecting.</p>
<a id="p5491" name="p5491"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5491)">He risked a look. He could see men with brands, running down the length of the wall; running back in the direction he'd come from. He trod water, watching. Even from here he could see the barrels were still on the beach. They'd failed to explode. His powder trail hadn't worked. The explosion must have been the barrel he'd opened&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;obviously there'd been a powder trail to that too! That accidental powder trail had worked. Well, there was nothing for it now but to swim on. They'd not expect someone to go on swimming away from the Hungarian lines.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5492" name="p5492"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5492)">By the time Benito got to the ledge, swimming was just about too much of an effort. Once he'd hauled himself out of the water and onto it, his strength was gone. He was exhausted. Too tired to contemplate a sixty-foot climb on greasy limestone with anything but dread.</p>
<a id="p5493" name="p5493"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5493)">But it had to be done. It seemed like an awfully long way. Benito hugged himself, and danced up and down on the ledge trying to get warm. He wasn't succeeding well. But the sky was definitely paling&#151;he wanted to be up this corner and over the wall before dawn or he was going to have a long wait on this ledge for nightfall. And he might be visible in daylight from the tower windows.</p>
<a id="p5494" name="p5494"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5494)">He began bridging his way up, one foot and one hand on either side of the corner, balancing between them. Fortunately it was a very nonstrenuous technique. A trick of balance, merely. Benito edged his way upwards toward the faint dark edge of the wall-top. He paused just below it, listening, although all he wanted to do was to get over that edge and rest. But there was no point in dying just yet. Not for the sake of a few dozen heartbeats.</p>
<a id="p5495" name="p5495"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5495)">Never had the top of even the most difficult building felt quite this satisfying to reach. Benito didn't walk away. He crawled to the stair&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;down it&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;To the deep shadows beside a building. He lay there for some time, trying to breathe quietly and gather himself up.</p>
<a id="p5496" name="p5496"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5496)">He was in, and almost home. Less likely to be shot, anyway. But he didn't want to end up in jail again, either.</p>
<a id="p5497" name="p5497"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5497)">So: Where did he go? Getting into the governor's palace like this was not going to be easy. Tiredly, his mind turned automatically to Maria. She wouldn't mind if he turned up half dead on her doorstep. And then&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;well, maybe that husband of hers&#151;or a note to Manfred. Or Francesca&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;or&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p5498" name="p5498"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5498)">He was too tired to think coherently. He stumbled through the narrow lanes, the dawn bell competing with the Hungarian cannon. He passed a few soldiers, coming off duty, yawning. One of them made a comment, but Benito simply wandered on. He obviously looked mad or drunk, but harmless, because they didn't follow after him.</p>
<a id="p5499" name="p5499"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5499)">He got there. The door was closed&#151;a drift of sand across the doorsill. The shutters were still tight, closed although the other houses were now coming to life. He knocked.</p>
<a id="p5500" name="p5500"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5500)">There was no reply.</p>
<a id="p5501" name="p5501"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5501)">He peered down the narrow passage that led to the back yard. That goat of hers had harassed passers-by from here. There was no goat, today. The place had that "nobody-lives-here" look.</p>
<a id="p5502" name="p5502"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5502)">Benito sat down on the steps. The doorknob was unpolished. The steps were full of wind-blown debris. Maria would never have allowed them to look like that.</p>
<a id="p5503" name="p5503"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5503)">A gray-haired old woman peered at him. "Who are you?"</p>
<a id="p5504" name="p5504"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5504)">"Uh. Benito. I'm looking for Maria and&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and Umberto." Here he was, without even a shirt, in salt-stained breeches, his body and face muddy. He wished he'd thought to wash when he'd been in the sea. Some of it obviously had washed away, but he'd chosen that fine-grained clay that needed hard rubbing. She'd think he was some kind of lunatic. However, looking at the old woman, he could see she really didn't seem to be all there herself. She'd made up half her face. The effect was a little odd, especially when added to the unfocused-looking eyes.</p>
<a id="p5505" name="p5505"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5505)">She sniffed, looking about to cry. "They've gone. The young man was shot. They've gone with that gorgeous baby. Like my baby. Babies always go&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." She wandered off, seemingly having forgotten all about him.</p>
<a id="p5506" name="p5506"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5506)">Benito took a deep breath and pulled himself together. First things first. He needed to get off the street. He'd been plain lucky so far, but that couldn't last. Besides, the old woman's rambling had worried him. Upset him even more than finding the person he'd always relied on, known would be there as a last resort, wasn't. Could Maria and the baby Alessia be&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;dead? He swallowed and vaulted the gate into the tiny yard.</p>
<a id="p5507" name="p5507"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5507)">Definitely no one had been here for a while.</p>
<a id="p5508" name="p5508"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5508)">Benito sat on the back step and formulated plans as best he could. The worry had pushed back exhaustion. If there was no Maria he'd have to turn to his other friend.</p>
<a id="p5509" name="p5509"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5509)">The roofs.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5510" name="p5510"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5510)">Francesca got up early. In a relative sense, anyway. When she'd had the misfortune to have to survive life in the Red Cat she'd thought she got up early. Then along had come Manfred, and with him, Erik, and she'd finally understood that all things are relative. "Early" to a hooker meant before noon. To a knight in training it meant before dawn.</p>
<a id="p5511" name="p5511"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5511)">With Erik away she'd thought Manfred might ease back on the predawn training. But he seemed to treat it as an act of faith.</p>
<a id="p5512" name="p5512"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5512)">Now, with the sun peeping through the shutters in long golden streamers, was a far better time. She swung the shutters open. And screamed.</p>
<a id="p5513" name="p5513"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5513)">It was a perfectly natural reaction to seeing someone dropping from the eaves and into her bedroom. It took her a moment of hasty retreat to recognize the dirty, half-naked stocky man, who simply sat down on the floor.</p>
<a id="p5514" name="p5514"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5514)">"Benito!"</p>
<a id="p5515" name="p5515"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5515)">"Yep. Why do you get up so late? I've been waiting for you to open up for hours."</p>
<a id="p5516" name="p5516"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5516)">"Why didn't you knock?"</p>
<a id="p5517" name="p5517"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5517)">"And get shot through the shutters? I tried calling quietly but you obviously didn't hear. Where's Prince Manfred?"</p>
<a id="p5518" name="p5518"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5518)">"Over at the exercise yard. I'll send someone for him. No, I'll go myself. Is Erik&#151;?"</p>
<a id="p5519" name="p5519"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5519)">"Fine." Benito yawned. "Got any food?"</p>
<a id="p5520" name="p5520"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5520)">"In the next room. Look, help yourself. I'm going to fetch Manfred. I haven't even done my hair!"</p>
<a id="p5521" name="p5521"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5521)">She left at a run. Francesca never ran.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5522" name="p5522"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5522)">Benito got wearily to his feet, went into the next room, and found a bottle of wine and a small loaf. He didn't bother to try any further. Just flopped down in a chair in the far corner and drank wine straight from the bottle with a few hunks of bread to keep it company.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5523" name="p5523"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5523)">"He just dropped in through the window," said Francesca, unlocking the door. "I nearly died of fright."</p>
<a id="p5524" name="p5524"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5524)">Manfred grinned. "Made your hair stand on end, did he?"</p>
<a id="p5525" name="p5525"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5525)">She looked dangerously at him. "I came straight out to call you without even thinking of brushing it, Manfred."</p>
<a id="p5526" name="p5526"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5526)">"You're beautiful even with all your hair standing on end, Francesca. Now where is the boy?"</p>
<a id="p5527" name="p5527"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5527)">"I left him here&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;oh."</p>
<a id="p5528" name="p5528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5528)">She'd spotted Benito, fast asleep, curled into the seat.</p>
<a id="p5529" name="p5529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5529)">Manfred surveyed the boy. Mud. Bruises, scratches. And a pair of tired breeches. A three-quarters-full wine bottle still clutched and half of a dropped loaf on the floor beside him.</p>
<a id="p5530" name="p5530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5530)">"I suppose he had to choose one of the good bottles," said Manfred, looking at it wryly. "The kid must be all in. He normally sleeps like a cat."</p>
<a id="p5531" name="p5531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5531)">"Should we let him sleep?"</p>
<a id="p5532" name="p5532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5532)">Manfred shook his head. "I'm afraid not. He can sleep once he's told us what is happening." He stepped over to the chair and began shaking Benito. The boy's skin was clammy to the touch. He was shivering faintly. "Here, Francesca. Get him a shirt and one of my cottes."</p>
<a id="p5533" name="p5533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5533)">Benito woke with a start. An eyes-unfocused start, reaching for a knife. "It's all right, Benito," said Falkenberg, beaming at him. "You're with us."</p>
<a id="p5534" name="p5534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5534)">Benito shook his head, obviously trying to clear it. "Sorry. Wine on an empty stomach. And I was a bit tired. Thanks." The latter was addressed to Francesca, who handed him a shirt and cotte.</p>
<a id="p5535" name="p5535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5535)">He stood up. Manfred noticed he was swaying. "Come on, Falkenberg, let's get him into those and he can sit down again."</p>
<a id="p5536" name="p5536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5536)">"I can dress myself."</p>
<a id="p5537" name="p5537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5537)">"Shut up," said Manfred, his big fingers struggling with buttons. "Or rather, tell us news. Francesca said you said Erik was all right?"</p>
<a id="p5538" name="p5538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5538)">Benito nodded. "Yeah. Fine. He's looking like the cat that ate the cream. He's got his Vinlander, and he's got his insurgents, and he's making the Hungarians bleed."</p>
<a id="p5539" name="p5539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5539)">"We've seen some of it from the walls, but I'm damned glad to hear it for certain." Manfred sat Benito down. "You've grown, boy. But my clothes are still a little big for you." That was something of an understatement. But at least he should be warmer. For an autumn day, it was warm. Benito wasn't.</p>
<a id="p5540" name="p5540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5540)">"So: What happened to the plans for getting you over to Italy? Is the blockade just too tight? Or are there just no fishing boats?"</p>
<a id="p5541" name="p5541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5541)">"I've been there and back. I came back with a hundred and fifty men to help Erik and news that the Arsenal is building a new fleet. As soon as they have the ships, Dorma will put to sea. There's a new war levy. They're recruiting mercenaries and calling for volunteers. The Old Fox himself has put up a thousand men."</p>
<a id="p5542" name="p5542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5542)">Manfred blinked. "There and back&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and back inside?" He looked at the wine standing on the floor. "And to think I begrudged you that. You deserve the entire bottle! In fact, make it a hogshead."</p>
<a id="p5543" name="p5543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5543)">"I'd rather have some brandy. Listen&#151;do you know what happened to Maria? My&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;my friend who told Erik. I went there first. It's all shut up."</p>
<a id="p5544" name="p5544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5544)">Francesca smiled knowingly. "She's fine, Benito. She's down at the Little Arsenal. Her husband got himself shot by the Libri d'Oro traitors. But he's recovering slowly. Look&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;is there anything else you really must ask him immediately, Manfred? Is there anything you really have to tell us, Benito?"</p>
<a id="p5545" name="p5545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5545)">Benito shook his head. "Just was told to bring the news that relief was coming. It might be four, five more months though. And I left a prisoner at the southern postern. Oh. And to ask that you hoist the Knots banner at the inner wall north tower at sundown. Tell Erik he's getting a saltcellar after all." Benito stood up on this cryptic utterance. "I'm going to the Little Arsenal."</p>
<a id="p5546" name="p5546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5546)">"Sit down. You need to rest," said Francesca firmly. "I'll go down and tell her."</p>
<a id="p5547" name="p5547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5547)">Benito shook his head. "You'd frighten her silly. Besides," he added, grinning in a pale shadow of his usual impishness, "I've got to tell her that Kat wants to know why she hasn't written. And I have to check on the baby for her god-mama. Heh. If you'd met the god-mama, you'd know I don't dare delay."</p>
<a id="p5548" name="p5548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5548)">Francesca shook her head disapprovingly, "I know men well enough to know I'd be wasting my time arguing. But Manfred, I think he needs an escort."</p>
<a id="p5549" name="p5549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5549)">Manfred nodded. "And his own clothes. Everyone would think a fair had come to town, otherwise."</p>
<a id="p5550" name="p5550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5550)">"I'm going <i>now</i>." There was a determined tilt to that chin and a feverish glint in Benito's eyes.</p>
<a id="p5551" name="p5551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5551)">"Fine, fine," said Falkenberg soothingly. "We'll just get you a horse."</p>
<a id="p5552" name="p5552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5552)">Benito closed his eyes momentarily. "Not a horse. Please!"</p>
<a id="p5553" name="p5553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5553)">"Well, at least wash your face!"</p>
<a id="p5554" name="p5554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5554)">&#160;</p>
