<h2 class="chapter">88</h2>

<p>There is a lot of ritual in human affairs. The Old Man started
me doing sermons from the Annals, the way he had himself in ancient
times. He was a firm believer in every man knowing his exact place
in our long history. And then most of the older hands were stuck
with teaching Taglian to anyone who did not speak it already.
Croaker wanted every brother to have a language in common with
every other. Sometimes it seemed we had as many native tongues as
we had men to speak them. I recalled no instance in the Annais when
the Company had become as polyglot as it was now.</p>

<p>Another burden I bore was keeping in shape by hoofing it across
to headquarters for staff meetings every few days.</p>

<p>A wonderful aroma wakened me. I shoved my head out of our
oft-improved bunker. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you cooking?&rdquo; I
asked Thai Dei.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Doj killed a wild pig last night. There will be
roast pork today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I can keep it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be ready for hours yet. You told me to
remind you of your staff meeting this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; It was supposed to be important, too. I did
not dare be late. &ldquo;Better save me some.&rdquo; I dragged my
ass out and made what morning preparations I could. None of us were
the sort who spent hours trimming our beards or prettying our hair
or taking baths. But you do have to splash a little water in your
face sometimes and you do have to get the crud out of your teeth
just so you feel like keeping on.</p>

<p>I wondered what would become of our teeth if we did not get
One-Eye back. Those tiny little spells he put on them, to protect
them, had to be renewed every two years. And we had battalions of
new men still lacking their initial exposures.</p>

<p>Thai Dei did not save me diddly. He took the pig off the fire
and followed me. There is just no ditching the man.</p>

<p>I was still not riding. Sleepy had not brought my mount back.
Sleepy had not come home yet himself, though he had had ample time.
He had disappeared while crossing the mountains. No search through
the ghostworld nor on site had produced a trace. I feared the
worst.</p>

<p>Two sleek crows followed me, gliding from bush to rock to ruin.
Otherwise there was no evidence to indicate that Soulcatcher
remained alive or was interested in us anymore, despite the
vandalism of her home. She was biding her time.</p>

<p>You could say that about the woman. She was crazy but never
impatient. Her temper did not control her.</p>

<p>Lady said she had escaped the barrage only because she had taken
Howler&rsquo;s carpet north so she could conspire with the
Radisha.</p>

<p>I had orders not to look for Soulcatcher. I had orders to run
whenever I sensed her presence. The same with Kina. Smoke was next
to useless now. I had become too valuable a resource to risk.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I glanced back before we started up the far slope. Uncle Doj was
trailing us, as he did so often. His step suggested he was ready
for anything. One hand rested on Ash Wand always.</p>

<p>Thai Dei and I had resumed training with him, want to or not. He
would not explain what was going on inside his head. He just kept
whacking away, forcing us to defend ourselves or enjoy painful
bruises.</p>

<p>He despaired of my ever reaching what he considered minimal
proficiency with a sword. He did not understand the difference
between a lone wolf warrior and a soldier who is part of a team of
mutually supporting fighters. Or he pretended not to
understand.</p>

<p>He expected trouble, no doubt about that. But it was too much
trouble to explain.</p>

<p>I have been running with Croaker long enough that I should be
used to that.</p>

<p>I reminded Thai Dei, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mushrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kept in the dark? Fed a diet of horseshit?&rdquo; You
would think that he would remember. But he was not interested in
trying. Like most Nyueng Bao attached to the Company. &ldquo;Never
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Doj tried to invite himself into the meeting. A couple of
hard-eyed guards stepped into his path. He chose to go hang around
with the other Nyueng Bao. He never did that before. He seemed to
be looking for JoJo, One-Eye&rsquo;s erstwhile bodyguard. JoJo was
never a gregarious sort, even among other Nyueng Bao.</p>

<p>I ducked inside the Old Man&rsquo;s dugout.</p>

<p>A whole herd of people had gathered in there. They were waiting
for me, apparently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Croaker said.
&ldquo;First, intelligence received. The rumor is true. Mogaba
definitely did sign on with the Radisha. He&rsquo;s started putting
together a force somewhere south of Dejagore. The reports
didn&rsquo;t explain where but did say his men have begun evicting
the locals from the best croplands so they can support themselves.
The leadership in Taglios hasn&rsquo;t decided exactly what to do
yet. There&rsquo;s actually a lot of sentiment for forgetting us
altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain did not reveal his sources. Some of that came from
me and Lady, dreaming and walking the ghost when Smoke was not
completely useless. He added, &ldquo;It seems Mogaba will enjoy the
support of several small auxiliary units raised by religious sects
with a grudge against us or our friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blade chuckled.</p>
