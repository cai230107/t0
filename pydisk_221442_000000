<a id="Heading12" name="Heading12"></a><h3 >DARAS</h3>
<h3 ><i>Summer 530 AD</i></h3>
<a id="p1068" name="p1068"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1068)" >The first day, after her return to Daras, Antonina spent with her son. Photius was ecstatic to see his mother, after a separation of several months&#151;the more so when he saw the small mountain of gifts which she had brought back for him from fabled Constantinople. Yet, for all that the boy kept one eager, impatient eye upon his fascinating new toys, he spent the first day cuddling with his mother.</p>
<a id="p1069" name="p1069"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1069)" >The seven-year-old's delight in the reunion was the product of simple joy, not relief. He had obviously been well treated during her absence. Indeed, suspected Antonina, hefting his weight, he had been spoiled outright.</p>
<a id="p1070" name="p1070"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1070)" >By the second day, of course, the imperative demand of new toys overwhelmed all filial devotion. At the crack of dawn, Photius was at his play. When his mother appeared, an hour or so later, the boy gave her no more than perfunctory words of greeting. Mothers, after all is said and done, are mothers. As cherishable as the sunrise, to be sure, but equally certain. <i>Toys</i>, now&#151;who knows when they might vanish, into whatever magic realm brought them forth?</p>
<a id="p1071" name="p1071"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1071)" >Antonina watched him at his play, for a bit. On another occasion, there might have been a touch of rueful regret in her son's preoccupation. But Antonina, in truth, was impatient to get on with her own pressing tasks. So it was not long before she headed off to the workshop where John of Rhodes awaited her.</p>
<a id="p1072" name="p1072"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1072)" >The workshop, she saw at a glance, had been considerably expanded during the months of her absence. And, as she drew nearer, she realized that John was no longer working alone. Through the open door of the workshop, she could hear the sound of voices.</p>
<a id="p1073" name="p1073"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1073)" >At first, the realization disconcerted her. She was swept with uneasiness. The past weeks in Constantinople had left her with a heightened sense of secrecy and security.</p>
<a id="p1074" name="p1074"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1074)" >Within seconds, however, uneasiness was pushed aside by another emotion. There could be only one reason that John had brought other men into his work.</p>
<a id="p1075" name="p1075"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1075)" >So it was hope, not anxiety, which quickened her last steps into the workshop.</p>
<a id="p1076" name="p1076"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1076)" >What she encountered, entering, melded both sentiments in an instant.</p>
<a id="p1077" name="p1077"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1077)" >A loud, crashing noise caused her to flinch.</p>
<a id="p1078" name="p1078"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1078)" >Fortunately. The flinch gave her the momentum to duck.</p>
<a id="p1079" name="p1079"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1079)" >Fortunately. The unknown missile whizzing by missed her head by a comfortable margin.</p>
<a id="p1080" name="p1080"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1080)" >Unlike the ricochet, which struck her squarely on the rump.</p>
<a id="p1081" name="p1081"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1081)" >The ricochet had little force behind it, however. It was surprise, more than pain, which tumbled her squawking to the floor.</p>
<a id="p1082" name="p1082"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1082)" >"In the name of Christ, Antonina!" bellowed John of Rhodes. "Can't you read a simple sign?"</p>
<a id="p1083" name="p1083"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1083)" >The naval officer arose from behind an upended table and stalked toward her. It was obvious, from its neat and tidy placement, that the table had been upended deliberately.</p>
<a id="p1084" name="p1084"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1084)" >John reached down a hand and hauled Antonina to her feet. Then, not relinquishing his grip on her wrist, he dragged her back through the doorway she had just entered.</p>
<a id="p1085" name="p1085"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1085)" >Outside, he spun her around. "Right there!" he roared. "Where everyone can see it!"</p>
<a id="p1086" name="p1086"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1086)" >He pointed triumphantly above the door.</p>
<a id="p1087" name="p1087"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1087)" >"In plain and simple Greek! It says&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1088" name="p1088"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1088)" >Silence. Antonina rubbed her rump, scowling.</p>
<a id="p1089" name="p1089"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1089)" >"Yes, John? It says <i>what?</i>"</p>
<a id="p1090" name="p1090"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1090)" >Silence. Then:</p>
<a id="p1091" name="p1091"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1091)" >"<i>Eusebius&#151;come here!</i>"</p>
<a id="p1092" name="p1092"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1092)" >A moment later, an apprehensive young man appeared in the doorway. He was short, thick, swarthy&#151;rather evil-looking, in fact. Not at all the image of the innocent cherub he was desperately trying to project.</p>
<a id="p1093" name="p1093"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1093)" >John pointed accusingly at the empty space above him.</p>
<a id="p1094" name="p1094"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1094)" >"Where's the sign I told you to hang there?" he demanded.</p>
<a id="p1095" name="p1095"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1095)" >Eusebius looked sheepish. "Forgot," he mumbled.</p>
<a id="p1096" name="p1096"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1096)" >John took a deep breath, blew it out, and began stumping about in the courtyard. His hands were firmly planted on his hips, arms akimbo.</p>
<a id="p1097" name="p1097"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1097)" >Antonina knew the signs. She was in no mood for one of the naval officer's tirades.</p>
<a id="p1098" name="p1098"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1098)" >"Never mind, John!" she exclaimed. "There's no harm done, other than to my dignity."</p>
<a id="p1099" name="p1099"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1099)" >"That's not the point!" snarled John. "This stuff is dangerous enough without some&#151;<i>fool boy!</i>&#151;forgetting&#151;<i>again!</i>&#151;to take simple precautions like hanging&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1100" name="p1100"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1100)" >"<i>What </i>dangerous stuff?" demanded Antonina, smiling brightly. "Oh&#151;that sounds exciting!"</p>
<a id="p1101" name="p1101"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1101)" >John broke off his stumping. He waved his arms.</p>
<a id="p1102" name="p1102"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1102)" >"We've got it, Antonina!" he cried excitedly. "We've got it! <i>Gunpowder! </i>Come on&#151;I'll show you!"</p>
<a id="p1103" name="p1103"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1103)" >He charged back inside. Eusebius, moving out of the way, gave Antonina a thankful glance.</p>
<a id="p1104" name="p1104"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1104)" >For the second time, Antonina entered the workshop.</p>
<a id="p1105" name="p1105"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1105)" ><i>Bang! Whizzzzz! Thump</i>.<i> Clatterclatterclatter.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1106" name="p1106"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1106)" >She scrambled back outside, ducking.</p>
<a id="p1107" name="p1107"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1107)" >Behind her, John's bellow:</p>
<a id="p1108" name="p1108"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1108)" ><i>"Eusebius&#151;you idiot! </i>Didn't I tell you to put out the slowmatch?"</p>
<a id="p1109" name="p1109"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1109)" >"Forgot," came the mutter.</p>
<a id="p1110" name="p1110"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1110)" >&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1111" name="p1111"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1111)" >"Outside of having the memory of an olive, he's really been a great help," said John later. He took a thoughtful sip of wine. "Chemistry isn't really my strong point. Eusebius has a knack for it like nobody I've ever seen."</p>
<a id="p1112" name="p1112"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1112)" >"Better hire someone to keep track of what he's supposed to remember, then," said Antonina, smiling.</p>
<a id="p1113" name="p1113"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1113)" >John set his cup down on the table firmly. Planted his hands on the table, firmly. Squared his shoulders, firmly.</p>
<a id="p1114" name="p1114"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1114)" >"We can't afford it, Antonina," he said. Firmly. "There's no point dancing about the matter." Scowl. "Procopius has been rubbing his hands with glee for a week, now. Ever since he got here ahead of you and went over the books." Fierce scowl. "He can't wait to tell you, the swine. I've gone through the money. All of it. Not a solidus<i> </i>left. Not one." Very fierce scowl. "And Sittas&#151;fat cheapskate!&#151;won't cough up anything more. He denounced me for a spendthrift the last time I asked."</p>
<a id="p1115" name="p1115"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1115)" >Antonina's smile didn't fade.</p>
<a id="p1116" name="p1116"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1116)" >"How many times have you hit him up?"</p>
<a id="p1117" name="p1117"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1117)" >Sullenly: "Eight. Well&#151;seven. Successfully."</p>
<a id="p1118" name="p1118"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1118)" >"Congratulations!" she laughed. "That's a record. No one else has ever squeezed money out of him more than twice in a row, so far as I know."</p>
<a id="p1119" name="p1119"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1119)" >John's smile was very thin.</p>
<a id="p1120" name="p1120"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1120)" >"It's not really a joke, Antonina. We can't go any further without money, and I don't know where it's going to come from. I can't get anything from Cassian, either. The Bishop's got his own problems. Patriarch Ephraim's been on a rampage lately, howling about church funds being misspent. His deacons have been crawling all over Anthony like fleas on a dog. They even counted his personal silverware."</p>
<a id="p1121" name="p1121"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1121)" >"What's the matter?" sneered Antonina. "Are Ephraim's silk robes wearing out?"</p>
<a id="p1122" name="p1122"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1122)" >There was a bit more humor in John's smile, now. Just a bit.</p>
<a id="p1123" name="p1123"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1123)" >"Not that I've noticed. Hard to keep track, of course, all the robes he's got. No, I think maybe he's peeved because he doesn't have as many pounds of gold on the rings of his left hand as he does on the right. Makes him list when he promenades through the streets of Antioch, blessing the poor."</p>
<a id="p1124" name="p1124"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1124)" >The naval officer snorted, sighed. He cast a glance around the room. They were sitting in the main salon of the villa, at a table in the corner. "I'd suggest selling one of your marvelous tapestries," he muttered, "except&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1125" name="p1125"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1125)" >"We don't have any."</p>
<a id="p1126" name="p1126"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1126)" >"Precisely."</p>
<a id="p1127" name="p1127"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1127)" >Antonina's smile turned into a very cheerful grin. She shook her head.</p>
<a id="p1128" name="p1128"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1128)" >"I should stop teasing you. I'm ashamed of myself. The fact is, my dear John, that money is no longer a problem. I have acquired a new financial backer for our project."</p>
<a id="p1129" name="p1129"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1129)" >She reached down and hauled up a sack. <i>Hauled.</i> The table clumped when she set it down.</p>
<a id="p1130" name="p1130"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1130)" >John's eyes widened. Antonina, still grinning, seized the bottom of the sack and upended it. A small torrent of gold coins spilled across the table.</p>
<a id="p1131" name="p1131"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1131)" >"Freshly minted, I hope you notice," she said gaily.</p>
<a id="p1132" name="p1132"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1132)" >John ogled the pile. It was not the coins themselves which held his gaze, however. It was his knowledge of what lay behind them.</p>
<a id="p1133" name="p1133"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1133)" >Power. Raw power.</p>
<a id="p1134" name="p1134"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1134)" >Since the reign of the emperors Valentinian and Valens, gold coin&#151;the solidus, inaugurated by Constantine the Great, which had been Rome's stable currency for two centuries&#151;were minted very exclusively.</p>
<a id="p1135" name="p1135"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1135)" >There were many legal mints in the Roman Empire. Big ones, in Thessalonica and Nicomedia, and a number of small ones in other cities. But they were restricted to issuing silver and copper coinage. By law, only the emperor minted gold coin. In Constantinople, at the Great Palace itself.</p>
<a id="p1136" name="p1136"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1136)" >"You told Theodora," he stated.</p>
<a id="p1137" name="p1137"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1137)" >Antonina nodded.</p>
<a id="p1138" name="p1138"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1138)" >"Was that wise?" he asked. There was no accusation in the question, simply curiosity.</p>
<a id="p1139" name="p1139"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1139)" >Antonina shrugged. "I think so. Under the circumstances, I didn't have much choice. I became deeply embroiled in imperial intrigue while I was in Constantinople. The reason Irene didn't come back with me is because she's now&#151;in fact if not in theory&#151;Theodora's spymaster."</p>
<a id="p1140" name="p1140"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1140)" >John eyed her with deep interest.</p>
<a id="p1141" name="p1141"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1141)" >"Malwa?"</p>
<a id="p1142" name="p1142"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1142)" >"Yes. They're developing some kind of treacherous plot, John. So far all we know is&#151;" She broke off. "Never mind. It's a long tale, and I don't want to have to tell it twice in the same day. Anthony, Michael and Sittas will be coming for dinner tonight. Maurice and Hermogenes will be there, too. They're also both involved, now. I'll explain everything then."</p>
<a id="p1143" name="p1143"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1143)" >She reached out a hand and began scooping the coins back into the sack. "Anyway, I think telling Theodora was necessary. And the right thing to do, for that matter. We'll know soon enough. She'll be coming here later this summer. For a full tour of the project."</p>
<a id="p1144" name="p1144"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1144)" >"<i>What?</i>"<i> </i>cried John. "<i>This summer?</i>" He leapt to his feet. Waved his arms angrily. "Impossible! Impossible! I won't have anything ready by then! Impossible!" He began stumping back and forth furiously. "Crazed women! No sense of reality&#151;none at all. Impossible. The gunpowder's still too unpredictable. The grenades are untested. Rockets aren't even that!"</p>
<a id="p1145" name="p1145"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1145)" >Stump, stump, stump.</p>
<a id="p1146" name="p1146"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1146)" >"Lunatic females. Think chemistry's like baking bread. There's something wrong with the way the powder burns, I know there is. Need to experiment with different ways of mixing the stuff."</p>
<a id="p1147" name="p1147"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1147)" >Stump, stump, stump.</p>
<a id="p1148" name="p1148"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1148)" >"Idiot girls. Maybe grind it, if I can figure out how to do it without blowing myself up. Maybe wet it first, that's an idea. What the hell, can't hurt."</p>
<a id="p1149" name="p1149"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1149)" >Stump, stump, stump.</p>
<a id="p1150" name="p1150"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1150)" >"Hell it can't! That moron Eusebius could blow up anything. Blow up a frigging pile of cow dung, you don't watch him. Careless as a woman."</p>
<a id="p1151" name="p1151"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1151)" >Stump, stump, stump.</p>
<a id="p1152" name="p1152"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1152)" >The early hours of the evening, before and during the meal, were primarily devoted to Procopius. It was not difficult. From months of practice, Antonina had developed the craft of Procopius-baiting to a fine art.</p>
<a id="p1153" name="p1153"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1153)" >In truth, her expertise was largely wasted. By now, Procopius was so well-trained that literally anything would serve the purpose. Like a yoked and blinkered mule pulling a capstan, he could see nothing before him but the well-trod path. Antonina had but to remark on a fine horse&#151;Procopius would scribble on the infamy of bestialism. Chat with a peasant housewife&#151;a treatise on the ancient sin of Sappho was the sure result. Place her son in her lap&#151;ah! splendid!&#151;Procopius would burn his lamp through the night, producing a veritable treatise on pedophilia and incest.</p>
<a id="p1154" name="p1154"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1154)" >So, her sultry glances at the men about the table, her veiled remarks, her giddy laughter, her sly innuendos&#151;even the joke about four soldiers and a pair of holy men being more than any woman could handle at one <i>sitting</i>&#151;giggle, giggle&#151;were a complete waste of effort. She could have been alone at the table, in the cold light of dawn, eating her meal in silence. By mid-morning, Procopius would be assuring anyone who listened that the harlot masturbated at breakfast.</p>
<a id="p1155" name="p1155"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1155)" >Soon enough, Procopius left the table and retired to his chamber. There was no need for Antonina to send him away on some pretext. The man was fairly bursting with anxiety to reach his quill.</p>
<a id="p1156" name="p1156"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1156)" >"God, I am sick of that man," snarled Sittas. For a moment, the general looked like he was going to spit out his wine. But only for a moment. He reconsidered, swallowed, poured himself a new goblet.</p>
<a id="p1157" name="p1157"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1157)" >"Is this absolutely necessary?" growled Michael of Macedonia.</p>
<a id="p1158" name="p1158"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1158)" >Antonina made a face. But before she could reply, Bishop Cassian spoke. Harshly:</p>
<a id="p1159" name="p1159"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1159)" >"Yes, Michael, it is. That foul creature&#151;though he's too stupid to know it&#151;is Malwa's chief spy on Antonina. He's the aqueduct which brings them the water of knowledge. Except that Antonina has seen to it that the aqueduct is actually a sewer, piping nothing but filth into their reservoirs." He smiled. It was quite a wicked smile, actually, for a bishop. Almost devilish. "We're not having a meeting here, plotting against Malwa. We're having an orgy!"</p>
<a id="p1160" name="p1160"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1160)" >Then, with a sly smile: "Is it your reputation which frets you so?"</p>
<a id="p1161" name="p1161"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1161)" >The Macedonian glared. "All reputation is folly," he pronounced. "Folly&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1162" name="p1162"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1162)" >"&#151;fed by pride, which is worse still," concluded the Bishop. His smile widened. "Really, Michael, you <i>must</i> develop a broader repertoire of proverbs."</p>
<a id="p1163" name="p1163"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1163)" >Antonina cleared her throat.</p>
<a id="p1164" name="p1164"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1164)" >"As I was saying . . ."</p>
<a id="p1165" name="p1165"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1165)" >"You weren't saying anything, Antonina," pointed out Cassian reasonably. "So I saw no reason not to idle away the time by a harmless&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1166" name="p1166"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1166)" >"Stop picking on Michael," grumbled Maurice. "He's done wonders with the local lads, and their wives and parents. Even the village elders aren't howling louder than a medium-sized storm at sea."</p>
<a id="p1167" name="p1167"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1167)" >"Well, of course he has!" exclaimed Cassian cheerfully. "He's a holy man. Must be good for something."</p>
<a id="p1168" name="p1168"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1168)" >Antonina headed off the gathering storm.</p>
<a id="p1169" name="p1169"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1169)" >"Tell me, Michael," she said forcefully. "What is your assessment? <i>Michael?</i>"</p>
<a id="p1170" name="p1170"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1170)" >The Macedonian broke off his (quite futile) attempt to glower down the bishop.</p>
<a id="p1171" name="p1171"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1171)" >"Excuse me, Antonina? I didn't catch that."</p>
<a id="p1172" name="p1172"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1172)" >"The peasants," she stated. "What is your assessment?"</p>
<a id="p1173" name="p1173"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1173)" >Michael waved his hand. It was not an airy gesture. Rather the opposite. So might a stone punctuate solidity.</p>
<a id="p1174" name="p1174"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1174)" >"There will be no problem. None."</p>
<a id="p1175" name="p1175"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1175)" >"More than that," added Maurice. "A good number of them, I think, would jump at the chance to join a new regiment." He eyed John of Rhodes. "Assuming there's something for them to do beside drive sheep at the enemy."</p>
<a id="p1176" name="p1176"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1176)" >John didn't rise to the bait.</p>

<a id="p1184" name="p1184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1184)" >Maurice slapped the table with the flat of his hand. "So let's not worry about it," he urged. "When the general gets back from India&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1185" name="p1185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1185)" >"<i>If</i>&#151;" murmured John.</p>

<a id="p1187" name="p1187"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1187)" >"Maurice has an idea," announced Sittas. The general beamed. "Marvelous idea, I think! And you know me&#151;I generally look on new ideas about the same way I look on cow dung."</p>
<a id="p1188" name="p1188"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1188)" >"What is it?" asked Antonina.</p>
<a id="p1189" name="p1189"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1189)" >Maurice rubbed his scalp. The gesture was one of his few affectations. The hair on that scalp was iron grey, but it was still as full as it had been when he was a boy.</p>
<a id="p1190" name="p1190"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1190)" >"I got to thinking. The problem with grenades is that you want to be able to heave them a fair distance before they blow up. Then, you face a tradeoff between distance and effectiveness. A man with a good arm can toss a grenade fairly far&#151;but only if it's so small it doesn't do much good when it lands. If he tries to throw a big grenade, he has to get well within bow range to do it." The veteran shrugged. "Under most battle conditions, my cataphracts would turn him into a pincushion before he got off more than one. I have to assume that the enemy could do as well. Persians could, for sure."</p>
<a id="p1191" name="p1191"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1191)" >"So what's your solution?" asked John. "Scorpions?"</p>
<a id="p1192" name="p1192"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1192)" >Maurice shook his head. "No. Mind you, I'm all for developing grenade artillery. Wouldn't be hard at all to adapt a stone-throwing scorpion for that purpose. But that's artillery. Fine in its place, but it's no substitute for infantry."</p>
<a id="p1193" name="p1193"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1193)" >Hermogenes smiled. He was one of the few modern Roman generals who specialized in infantry warfare. Belisarius himself had groomed the young officer, and urged him in that direction.</p>
<a id="p1194" name="p1194"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1194)" >"Or cavalry," grumbled Sittas. <i>This </i>general, on the other hand, was passionately devoted to the cataphract traditions.</p>
<a id="p1195" name="p1195"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1195)" >"Forget cavalry," said Maurice. "These lads are peasants pure and simple, Sittas. Syrian peasants, to boot.

<a id="p1196" name="p1196"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1196)" >Sittas nodded, quite magnanimously. The honor of the cavalry having been sustained, he would not argue the point further.</p>
<a id="p1197" name="p1197"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1197)" >"And that's the key," stated Maurice. "I tried to figure out the best way to combine Syrian peasants and grenades, starting with the strengths and limitations of both. The answer was obvious."</p>

<a id="p1207" name="p1207"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1207)" >"But these <i>aren't</i> Balearic slingers, Maurice," demurred Antonina. "The islanders are famous&#151;have been for centuries. These are just farm boys."</p>
<a id="p1208" name="p1208"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1208)" >Maurice shrugged. "So what? Every one of those peasants&#151;especially the shepherds&#151;has been using a sling since he was a boy. Sure, they're not professionals like the Balearic islanders, but that doesn't matter for our needs. The only real difference between a Balearic mercenary slinger and a peasant lad is accuracy. That matters when you're slinging iron bullets. It doesn't&#151;not much, anyway&#151;when you're hurling grenades."</p>
<a id="p1209" name="p1209"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1209)" >John started to get excited, then. "You know&#151;you're right! How far could one of these Syrian boys toss a grenade?"</p>

<a id="p1241" name="p1241"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1241)" >Soon enough, however, Michael of Macedonia made his appearance. He said nothing, neither to the generals nor to the peasants.

<a id="p1293" name="p1293"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1293)" >"Very well, Antonina. I cannot stop you, in any event. I will give you all the assistance which I can."</p>

<a id="p1295" name="p1295"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1295)" >"Won't be much, when it comes to military matters and Hippodrome factions." He waved his knife cheerfully.

<a id="p1297" name="p1297"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1297)" >"Glycerius of Chalcedon and George Barsymes, is it?"</p>
<a id="p1298" name="p1298"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1298)" >The dates disappeared as if by magic. He skewered a pear.</p>
<a id="p1299" name="p1299"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1299)" >"Rufinus Namatianus, Bishop of Ravenna," he mumbled thoughtfully, his mouth full of shredding fruit. "Know'm well."</p>

<a id="p1303" name="p1303"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1303)" >After the generals returned, at sundown, Antonina listened to their ranting and raving for half an hour. Tact and diplomacy, she thought, required as much.</p>

<a id="p1306" name="p1306"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1306)" >The generals gobbled. John of Rhodes began to stump. Antonina examined them curiously.</p>
