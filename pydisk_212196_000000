<h2 class="chapter">47</h2>

<p>The storm lingered a long time. A couple times I almost became
lost just getting from my shelter to One-Eye&rsquo;s wagon or
Croaker&rsquo;s shelter. The blizzard brought air so cold we had to
move Smoke into Croaker&rsquo;s place to keep him from freezing.
The soldiers suffered badly, though mostly through their own
failure to provide themselves with adequate shelter. Captives had
warned them that winter here would be much harsher than any they
had ever known.</p>

<p>Once again I got to know the joys of sharing quarters with
Mother Gota.</p>

<p>Thai Dei insisted she had to get in out of the weather and I
have been developing a soft streak as I get older. I allowed
it.</p>

<p>She behaved uncharacteristically for Ky Gota. She kept her own
counsel most of the time. She stayed out of the way. She helped
Thai Dei dig out cold earth and carry it away so we would have more
room. She did not say a disparaging word about all the time I spent
writing. She worked hard, though I never had been able to criticize
her on that account, ever.</p>

<p>She made me nervous. She was almost human. Though she made very
little effort to be pleasant or friendly.</p>

<p>The Captain, though, was sharing space with One-Eye and Smoke
for the duration. He was much less happy than I was. And I was not
happy because I was getting almost no chance to travel with Smoke.
When I did stumble over there they would not let me go ghostwalking
long enough to do more than check something specific, which was
always something on a list they had prepared but claimed not to
have had time to check for themselves.</p>

<p>Croaker did not ghostwalk much but he did not let the blizzard
and its aftermath keep him from working on other stuff.</p>

<p>Over there in Overlook, Longshadow and Howler were putting in
hours as long as ours. And when he was not with his ally Howler,
the Shadowmaster had his head together with Narayan.</p>

<p>Singh seemed to have perked up now that he had an almost friend.
The Daughter of Night seemed content to ignore everybody and live
entirely within herself.</p>

<p>Fighting continued inside the fortress. I almost had to envy our
guys who were trapped in there. They were scared all the time but
they were warm and most of the time they had enough to eat.</p>

<p>Fresh snow fell every three days. Harsh winds never stopped
blowing. I began to worry about the wood we needed to keep going.
The snow was so deep it was almost impossible to get around. Nobody
knew how to make snowshoes. Probably only three or four Old Crew
guys besides me knew what snowshoes were.</p>

<p>I thought it was a great time for Longshadow to send out some of
his pet shadows but he failed to grab the advantage. He was not
confident that Howler could withstand Lady by himself, nor, I
suspect, did he want to turn his back on his partner for long.</p>

<p>The dreams intensified. They diversified as well. I went to the
plain of death and the caves of ice and I went to the Nyueng Bao
delta swamps to see Sahra and into the hills and mountains behind
us where I caught glimpses of Goblin and Mogaba in huddled hiding
places trying to wait out the weather.</p>

<p>Those dreams all seemed very real.</p>

<p>Even more real seemed my dreams of Soulcatcher, whose lonesome
misery was epic. The place she had chosen to hole up seemed to pull
snow and wind both, till the former was deeper than she was
tall.</p>

<p>The first two times I suffered these dreams I took them
passively. The third night my own presence there seemed so real
that I tried tinkering with reality.</p>

<p>The dream did not change but my place within it did.</p>

<p>I experimented much more next night.</p>

<p>The morning afterward, after a not entirely inedible breakfast
prepared by Mother Gota, I slogged through the snow to visit the
Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had to get away?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being bad. The old woman&rsquo;s even
fixing food that&rsquo;s palatable. If you&rsquo;re not real
picky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Where&rsquo;s your shadow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the
snow.&rdquo; The snow was the first thing I had seen that made
Thai Dei want to back down. This winter was his first extensive
experience with the white stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us do. Anything from the old guy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this weather? You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo; He was
still sure that Uncle Doj was up to something. Maybe I ought to
dream about him. &ldquo;What I wanted you to know is, my dreams are
getting really strange.&rdquo; I explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it your imagination or are you really going
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels like being out there with Smoke. Almost. I
don&rsquo;t have any feeling of control. So far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Croaker grunted. He looked thoughtful, seeing some
possibilities. I saw a few myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I thought was, I could make a quick circuit with
Smoke to see how closely reality conforms to what I dreamed.&rdquo;
I had little trouble accepting the possibility because I had been
experiencing such unusual dreams for so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it. Without wasting any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry? This snow isn&rsquo;t going
anywhere for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Croaker grunted again.</p>

<p>He was turning into a genuine old fart.</p>

<p>The flight with Smoke showed me nothing I had not seen in my
dreams. It did not show me Soulcatcher. Smoke still refused to get
close. But I passed high overhead and saw that she was indeed
caught in a side canyon where the snow was extremely deep.</p>
