<h2 class="chapter">14 WITCH WEAPON</h2>

<p>JAELITHE HAD journeyed on Sulcar ships before, but never into the
void of mid-ocean. There was a vast impersonality about the sea
which undercut her confidence in herself in a way she had never
known before. Only the knowledge that her witchdom had not been
swept away was her support. The witches had the reputation of
being able to control natural forces. Perhaps on land they could
summon up a storm, a mist or weave hallucinations to control the
mind. But the sea was a power in itself and the farther the <em>Wave
Cleaver</em> sailed the less sure Jaelithe was.</p>

<p>Simon&rsquo;s fear that they might have awakened the suspicions of the Kolder, oddly enough, steadied her. Men&mdash;even the Kolder, alien as they were&mdash;she could face
better than this rolling immensity of wind-driven wave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no land reckoned hereby on any chart.&rdquo;

<p>Captain Stymir had out his rolls of sea maps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have none of your exploring ships ever reached in this
direction before?&rdquo; Jaelithe asked, seeing in his very
bewilderment something strange.</p>

<p>Stymir continued to study the top chart, tracing markings with
his finger. Then he called over his shoulder, &ldquo;Pass the word
for Jokul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crewman who came in answer to that hail was a small man,
bent by the years, his brown face seamed and salt-dried. He walked
with a lurch and go and Jaelithe saw his right leg was stiff and a
little shorter than the left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jokul,&rdquo; Stymir flattened the chart with a broad
hand, &ldquo;where are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smaller man&rsquo;s head came up. He pulled off a knitted
cap so that the wind lay over his tight braids of faded hair, his
somewhat large nose pointed into that breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the lost trace, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stymir&rsquo;s frown grew the deeper. He studied the filled
sails above them as if their billowing had taken on a sinister
meaning. Jokul still sniffed that wind, advancing a step or two
down the deck. Then he pointed to the sea itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thread of red-brown on the green, whipped up and down with the
rise and fall of the swell, trailed on near to another patch.
Jaelithe&rsquo;s gaze, following that, saw that closer to the
horizon there was an all red-brown patch. And the change in the
captain&rsquo;s expression made her break silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brought his fist down with a thumping blow. &ldquo;That must be it!&rdquo; His frown was gone. &ldquo;This is
why&mdash;the weed and the lost trace!&rdquo; Then he turned to her. &ldquo;If your
course
leads there, lady, then&mdash;&rdquo; His hands were up and out
in a gesture of bafflement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she demanded for the second time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weed, it is an ocean thing, living on the surface
of the waves in these warmer waters. We have known it
long and it is common. One may find bits of it washed
ashore after any storm. But there is this about the weed&mdash;it has been increasing and now the patches have that
on
them which kills&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kills how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stymir shook his head. &ldquo;We do not know, lady. A man
touches it and it is as if his hands are burned in a fire. The
burns spread upon his skin, his body, and afterwards, he dies. It
is some poison in the weed&mdash;and wherever it floats we no
longer go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it is in the water and you are on board ship, do
you need to fear the touch?&rdquo; she countered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let a ship touch it and it clings, clings and
grows&mdash;aboard!&rdquo; Jokul broke in. &ldquo;It has not always
been so, lady, only for some years now. So the ocean paths it takes
we must now avoid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only lately,&rdquo; Jaelithe repeated. &ldquo;Since the
Kolder have grown so bold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kolder?&rdquo; Stymir stared at the floating weed in open
bewilderment. &ldquo;Kolder&mdash;weed&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Kolder ships go under the surface of the sea,&rdquo;
Jaelithe pointed out. &ldquo;How better could they protect their
trail than to sow trouble above where any enemy must
follow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain turned to Jokul. &ldquo;The lost trace&mdash;where
did it lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nowhere that we wished to go,&rdquo; the crewman
answered promptly. &ldquo;A few barren islands which have
nothing. Water, food, people, even the sea birds are scarce
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barren islands? Are they not on your chart,
Captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flattened out the top one again. &ldquo;Not so, my lady.
But if this is the lost trace, then it may be that we cannot
follow it farther. For the nature of the weed is such that first
it appears in such strings as yonder, then in patches, as you see
farther beyond. These patches thicken, not only in number but in
depth, so that they make small islets borne on the sea, and then
larger islets, and at last, if anyone has the folly to push in,
they are a solid mass. This, too, was not always so. The weed made
islands, aye, but not so solid&mdash;nor was it death to hunt
there. I have harvested crabs for the eating. But now no man goes
near that ocean stain. Does it not seem as blood washing from a
gaping wound? The very sign of the death it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one cannot penetrate so far how does one know of these
isles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first we did not know the danger. A floating ship with
dying men on her deck drifted out of the weed. And of those who
chanced upon that vessel and went to their rescue five more died
because the weed had fastened to her hull and they had brushed
against it. So did we learn, lady. If the Kolders have indeed set
this defense about their hold, it is one we cannot face unless we
work out some plan against the weed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The floating weed&mdash;Jaelithe had to accept their word upon
its danger. The Sulcar kind knew the sea and all its
concerns&mdash;that was their mystery. The weed . . . But she no
longer saw that trail like blood on the sea. Her hands went to her
head and she swayed at an imperative summons. Simon!</p>

<p>Simon in the Kolder base&mdash;that way&mdash;beyond the
floating death. They must head into&mdash;through&mdash;that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon,&rdquo; her reply sought him urgently, &ldquo;there
is danger between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay off! Do not risk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curtain between them now. She could not penetrate that despite
frantic efforts. Kolder curtain. Did they know, or was that only
usual precautions? Simon!</p>

<p>Jaelithe felt as if she had screamed that name, it was a
tearing pain in her throat. But when she opened her
eyes Stymir showed no alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we seek lies beyond there,&rdquo; she said
dully, pointing to the horizon where rode the weed. &ldquo;Perhaps they also know that we come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain! The weed!&rdquo; Not a warning from Jokul, but a
cry from the mainmast lookout.</p>

<p>One trail&mdash;one patch. No! A dozen trails now, all reaching
out deadly tendrils for them. Stymir roared orders to bring the
ship about, send it backtracking. Jaelithe sped for the cage on
mid-deck.</p>

<p>The great white falcon welcomed her with a scream as she clicked
open the latch of the cage. She stiffened her arm to support its
weight as it hooked its heavy claws about her flesh and bone,
sidled out to freedom. Fastened to one of those strong legs was
what she sought, a tiny mechanism in a rod which the bird could
carry with ease. Jaelithe drew a deep breath, to steady her nerves
and quiet the racing of her heart. This was a delicate business and
she dared make no mistakes. Her finger nail found the tiny
indentation in the rod, and she pressed that in code pattern. The
bird in flight would automatically register, on this triumph of
the Falconers&rsquo; devices, the course and distance. But the tale
of the weed was another matter which she must record for the
Falconers to decode. That done she carried the bird to the
afterdeck, speaking to it softly meanwhile. Falconers&rsquo;
secrets remained secrets as far as their allies were concerned. How
much the bird actually understood Jaelithe could not tell. Whether
it was training or bred intelligence which made this falcon
superior was a matter for argument. But that it was their only
chance to warn the fleet following she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly straight, fly fast, winged one.&rdquo; She drew a
finger down the head as those fierce eyes met hers. &ldquo;This is
your time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a scream the falcon tore skyward, circled the
ship once, and then shot as a dart back towards the long-vanished land. Jaelithe turned to the sea. The tendrils of weed
advanced, a swelling web of them reaching for the ship. Surely,
surely their rapid drawing in upon the vessel was not natural. How
could floating weed move so swiftly and with a purpose, as she was
sure was happening now. Oh, if she only had her jewel! There was
more than hallucinations to be controlled through that. At times of
great emergency it could pull upon a central store of energy,
common to all the witchdom of Estcarp, and so accomplish tangible
results.</p>

<p>But she had no jewel, and what she could use was not the power
she had known before. Jaelithe watched the fingers of the weed and
tried to think. It lay upon the surface&mdash;and so far there were
no thick islands such as Stymir had feared. Under the water was
safe, but the <em>Wave Cleaver</em> could not go below as did a Kolder
ship.</p>

<p>Water gave the stuff support and life. Her fingers moved in a
studied pattern on the rail before her. Jaelithe found herself
reciting one of the first and earliest of the spells she had ever
learned: one to impress upon a child&rsquo;s mind the base for all
&ldquo;changing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air and earth, water and fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fire&mdash;the eternal opposition to water. Fire could dry
water, water could quench fire. Fire&mdash;the word lingered with a
small beat in her mind. And Jaelithe knew that beat of old, the
sign every witch waited for, the sign-post of a spell ready to
work. Fire! But how could fire be the answer on the ocean&mdash;a
weapon against drifting weed which was poison to what it
touched?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; She turned to Stymir. He scowled at her
as if she was only a distraction in his battle to save his
ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sea oil&mdash;you have sea oil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His expression changed to one of a man facing a hysterical
woman, but she was already continuing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weed, will it burn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn&mdash;on the water?&rdquo; His protest was halted as
if a
thought struck home. &ldquo;Sea oil&mdash;fire!&rdquo; He
connected those
with the rapidity of a man who had improvised before
in the face of danger. &ldquo;No, lady, I do not know whether it
will burn&mdash;but one can try!&rdquo; He shouted an order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alavin, Jokul, get up three skins of oil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The skins of thick oil, skimmed from the boil off langmar stems,
kept for use in storms, were brought to the deck and Stymir himself
made the small cuts on their upper surfaces before they were
lowered on lines to drag behind the <em>Wave Cleaver</em>. The oil began to
ooze forth some distance from the ship.</p>

<p>It showed as a distinct stain on the waves, spreading as the
leaking bags were rolled and mauled by the force of the waves. When
that dark shadow made a goodly streak, one of the marines went
aloft. His dart gun had been checked by Stymir and a round dozen in
the clip load were the burst-fire type, used to set aflame an
enemy&rsquo;s rigging and sails.</p>

<p>They watched the patch eagerly. The strings of weed had reached
it, had pushed on so that weed was discolored. There was a burst
of eye-searing white fire on one of those soggy tendrils. Soaring
flames licked along the oil slick&mdash;from more than one place
now as the marksman placed his darts.</p>

<p>Smoke rose in a haze and the wind drove to them a stench to set
them coughing. Flames roared higher and higher. Stymir laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than oil feeds that! The weed burns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But would more than just the oil-soaked tendrils burn? That was
the important question now. Unless those branches of weed ignited
and the fire spread to the other patches, they had not gained more
than a small measure of time, a very small measure.</p>

<p>If she only had the jewel! Jaelithe tensed, strained against the
bond of impotence. Her lips moved, her hands cupped as if she did
hold that weapon. She began to sing. No one had ever understood why
the gems worked to focus the magic wrought by will and mind.</p>

<p>If their secret had once been known to her people, it
lay so far back in the dim corridor of their too-long history as to be buried in the dust of ages. The making of the
jewel itself, the tuning of it to the personality of she who was to
wear it, probably for the rest of her life, that they could do. And
the training of how to use it properly, that was also a matter of
lessoning. But why it worked so and who first discovered this means
. . .</p>

<p>The archaic words of her chant meant nothing now either.
Jaelithe only knew that they had to be used to raise the power
within her, make it flood her body, and then flow outward. And,
though she had no jewel, she was doing now what she would have done
had it lain on her palm, pulsating with her song.</p>

<p>She was no longer aware of the captain, of the crew, even visual
and tactile contact with the ship was gone. Although no mist born
of magical herbs and gums wreathed her in as it must for the
difficult raisings, Jaelithe was as blind as if she was so
enfolded. And all the will which seethed within her body, had been
bottled in her since she laid aside the witch gem, was thrust at
the fire, as if she held a spear within her two hands and aimed it
at the centermost point of the flames.</p>

<p>Those were reaching higher and higher into the sky; then their
red tips bent&mdash;not towards the ship, but away&mdash;back at
the center mass of the weed on the borders of which they fed: away
and down. Jaelithe&rsquo;s chant was a murmur of storm afar. They
might have loosed a whole shipload of oil rather than three skins.
Stymir and his crew stood agape at the holocaust spouting behind
them. A forest in full blaze could hardly have produced more
cloud-reaching tongues of flame.</p>

<p>There was a clap of noise and a second before they were hardly
more than conscious of the first.</p>

<p>Jaelithe stiffened, for a moment her voice wavered.
Kolder&mdash;Kolder devices within the weed! She aimed her
will&mdash;the fire against Kolder blankness. Were there underwater
ships slinking out to do battle? But the fire continued to bend to
her will.</p>

<p>Those sharp explosions were coming faster. Half the
horizon was aflame and the heat of it struck at the ship, the
stench of the burning made a gas to set them choking. Still
Jaelithe sang and willed, fought for the death of the weed. And the
weed died, shriveled, cooked, became ash awash on the waves.
Jaelithe knew a swell of triumph, a wild joy which, in its way,
could be as defeating as the fire. She fought against that sense of
triumph, beat it down with all her might.</p>

<p>No more red trails across the water, the flames had eaten those
into nothingness. Now the fire fed on the larger mass behind them.
The <em>Wave Cleaver</em>&rsquo;s crew watched as the day went and night
drew in, but still there was a distant glow along the horizon. And
then Jaelithe slumped against the rail, her voice naught but a
husky croak. Stymir steadied her while one of the men went running
for a cup of ship&rsquo;s wine, thin and sour, but wet to ease
somewhat the dried agony of her mouth. She drank and drank again,
and then smiled at the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire will eat it to the end, I think,&rdquo; she said
in the whisper which was the only voice left her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was great magic, lady.&rdquo; And the respect in his
voice was that a Sulcarman kept for some great feat of seamanship
or notable stroke in battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How great you do not know, Captain. The oil and the fire
darts gave it birth, but the shaping by will set it deep.
And&mdash;&rdquo; She raised her empty hands and stared at them now
with wonder, &ldquo;And I had no gem! I had no gem!&rdquo; She
strove to stand away from Stymir and staggered, as weak as one
risen from a sick bed of long enduring.</p>

<p>The captain half led, half carried her below, helped her to
stretch out on the bunk, where she now lay, trembling with a
terrible fatigue. She had felt nothing such as this since her
earliest days of training. But before she lapsed into the
unconsciousness which lapped about her as the sea lapped the ship,
Jaelithe caught at Stymir&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you now sail on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He studied her. &ldquo;This may be only the first of their defenses and the least. But after what I have
seen&mdash;aye&mdash;for now we sail on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is trouble&mdash;call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now there was a smile about his lips. &ldquo;Be very sure of
that, lady. A man does not hesitate to use a good weapon when it
lies to hand. And we still have several skins of oil
below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left and she pillowed her head with a sigh of half content,
too tired now to examine this new knowledge, to taste it, feel it
warm about her like a cloak against the chill of a winter storm.
She thought that her tie with Simon had been her new skill, but it
would seem there was another&mdash;and there could be more to
discover. Jaelithe stretched her aching body and fell asleep,
smiling.</p>
