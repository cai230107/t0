<blockquote>
<a id="p3905" name="p3905"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3905)" style="text-indent:0"><i>The fundamental purpose of the Baronial Council is to force the Biemish barons to put themselves under my sword; whether they walk out with or without their heads is up to me, and depends on their behavior.</i><br /><i>The Holts are a different case. They haven't been called in for Council, yet, not because they don't </i>"<i>deserve</i>" <i>it or some such nonsense, but because they're already under Imperial control. Hell, the Holtish barons' military governors can hang them first, and explain it to me later.</i><br /><i>As we start to return Holtun to civilian rule, though, the Holtish barons will have to attend council, too. It'll just about double the council size. Which will at least quadruple the amount of time spent in meetings.</i><br /><i>I wish I knew British history better. Is this the way Parliament started?</i>&#160;</p>

<a id="p3911" name="p3911"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3911)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p3912" name="p3912"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3912)">Jason stood outside the great hall, waiting, until he decided he'd had enough of waiting.</p>
<a id="p3913" name="p3913"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3913)">At the door he stopped next to the ceremonial guard&#151;a short, loud-voiced corporal named Nartham&#151;wondering how he was going to be announced, realizing that he'd forgotten to arrange it. Nartham had presented Thomen with a loud "Thomen, Baron Furnael, the regent"&#151;Thomen was here as both regent and noble, not as a judge&#151;but what was right for Jason?</p>
<a id="p3914" name="p3914"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3914)">He rapped the butt of his halberd on stone three times to get everyone's attention. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Heir."</p>
<a id="p3915" name="p3915"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3915)">Jason walked across the carpet, trying to make it look slow and graceful, feeling more awkward than he'd ever felt before. Thomen had primed him for the council, but it just didn't feel right.</p>
<a id="p3916" name="p3916"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3916)">He paused for a moment at the foot of the table. Mother's chair. Standing next to it, Doria gave him a slight nod, then put her hands together and tilted her head, miming sleep.</p>
<a id="p3917" name="p3917"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3917)">Good. Aeia's eyes twinkled as she stood by her chair, her back just a bit too ramrod-straight, as though to say, <i>I used to change your diapers, Jason: I'm not about to take you seriously as a ruler.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p3918" name="p3918"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3918)">"Good evening," he said, keeping his voice level, as he took his seat&#151;<i>his </i>seat!&#151;at the head of the table. "Be seated, all. We have a full agenda."</p>
<a id="p3919" name="p3919"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3919)">The Biemish barons, each with a single adviser, seated themselves along the left side of the table, while Holtish barons, each save one with the military governor of his barony, took seats on the right.</p>
<a id="p3920" name="p3920"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3920)">Vilmar, Baron Nerahan, was conspicuously alone, as though to remind everyone present that his was the single Holtish barony released from direct Imperial government. The trim, compact man settled stiffly into his chair, then smoothed the pleated front of his immaculate white tunic before folding his hands genteelly in his lap and turning a vaguely interested but generally blank expression on the world, the eyes under the heavy brows missing nothing.</p>
<a id="p3921" name="p3921"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3921)">Still standing was Tennetty, who moved back and leaned against the near wall. Clad as usual in a mannish leather tunic and worn leggings, she hitched at her combo belt as though to remind everyone present that she was carrying a blooded saber, a Nehera-made bowie and two loaded pistols, instead of a formal smallsword.</p>
<a id="p3922" name="p3922"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3922)">Thomen leaned over and whispered in his ear. "I asked the dragon to be around in time for this, but he isn't back, yet. We'd best handle the simple items first. But you'll have to start with the matter of your mother." Thomen beckoned to the court secretary, a burly engineer who looked incongruous sitting at the writing desk next to the long table of the great hall. The red-bearded man looked like he'd be much happier taking a shift in the gunworks.</p>
<a id="p3923" name="p3923"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3923)">Thomen gave a slight nod.</p>
<a id="p3924" name="p3924"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3924)">"Very well," Jason said, rising. Thomen had been explicit: he must start on his feet. Tower over them, dominate the meeting, make it clear that he was in charge. Even if he wasn't. Particularly if he wasn't.</p>
<a id="p3925" name="p3925"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3925)">"Welcome, all, to the council. There's much to discuss tonight, so I'll skip any long speech about how much we all miss my late father, and let us get down to work. First item: the absence of my mother. She's been working far too hard lately, and has been ordered to rest herself for the next few days, until I leave."</p>
<a id="p3926" name="p3926"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3926)">There was a quiet rush of muttering at that.</p>
<a id="p3927" name="p3927"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3927)">Thomen spoke up. "We know that you'll all wish to pay your respects in person to the empress, so I've arranged for your quartering for the next few days."</p>
<a id="p3928" name="p3928"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3928)">Bren Adahan shook his head. "Maybe the rest can stay, but Ranella and I ought to get back to Adahan, by way of Furnael and Little Pittsburgh. Production's slipping, and we've got to find out what's behind it&#151;from the reports, it sounds like there's supply problems in Adahan, but&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3929" name="p3929"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3929)">An emperor, even an emperor-to-be, has to be obeyed. "Ranella can handle it. You'll do as you're told," Jason said.</p>
<a id="p3930" name="p3930"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3930)">The room was suddenly cold. Bren Adahan had spoken casually; he hadn't been ready for Jason to bite his head off.</p>
<a id="p3931" name="p3931"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3931)">"Your pardon, sire," Bren Adahan said. "You are quite correct; I shall do precisely as I am told. It was a figure of speech; I meant to inform you and the regent that there are urgent matters requiring attention in both my barony and in barony Furnael, and to suggest that Governor Ranella and I ought to handle them." He inclined his head perhaps a mite too deeply, then straightened, his expression stony.</p>
<a id="p3932" name="p3932"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3932)">Thomen momentarily rolled his eyes heavenward, while the others around the table stirred.</p>
<a id="p3933" name="p3933"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3933)">Flame flared in the windows.</p>
<a id="p3934" name="p3934"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3934)">*Good evening, all,* Ellegon said, announcing himself as he thumped to the ground in the courtyard outside. Leathery wings flapped in the breeze as the dragon settled himself in.</p>
<a id="p3935" name="p3935"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3935)">*And good evening to you,* Ellegon said, his mental voice taking on the timbre that told Jason the dragon was talking to him alone, *shit-for-brains. Looks like I got here too late.*</p>
<a id="p3936" name="p3936"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3936)"><i>What are you talking about? And what kept you?&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3937" name="p3937"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3937)">*Nothing important. I just picked up a small party traveling later than seemed sensible, so I had to duck behind the next hill and wait until they pulled around the bend close enough that I could read them. They were clean.*</p>
<a id="p3938" name="p3938"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3938)">The dragon's caution made sense. Ever since Ellegon had been shot during the Holtun-Bieme War, Ellegon had been careful of approaching humans. Much better for Ellegon to have some cover between himself and some unknowns than to try to fly low enough to deeply read them, and risk being taken by an assassin's dragonbane-tipped crossbow bolt.</p>
<a id="p3939" name="p3939"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3939)">Everybody was looking at Jason, waiting.</p>
<a id="p3940" name="p3940"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3940)">"Well," he said, "where were we?"</p>
<a id="p3941" name="p3941"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3941)">*You're about to apologize to Bren Adahan. That's where we are. Now, Jason.*</p>
<a id="p3942" name="p3942"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3942)"><i>But&#151;&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3943" name="p3943"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3943)">*Don't argue, just repeat after me: My apologies, Baron Adahan&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.*</p>
<a id="p3944" name="p3944"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3944)">"My apologies, Baron Adahan&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3945" name="p3945"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3945)">*&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;you'll have to excuse me&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.*</p>
<a id="p3946" name="p3946"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3946)">"&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;you'll have to excuse me&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p3947" name="p3947"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3947)">*&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but as you all know, I'm new to this ruling business, and I'm afraid it's set my temper a bit on edge&#151;and you'd damn well better smile ingratiatingly here, asshole.*</p>
<a id="p3948" name="p3948"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3948)">"I'm&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;really new to this ruling business, and I think it must have set my temper on edge."</p>
<a id="p3949" name="p3949"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3949)">He tried to smile ingratiatingly, but wasn't sure if it came off. Jason Cullinane couldn't ever remember trying to smile ingratiatingly before. He was one of the people others smiled ingratiatingly <i>at.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p3950" name="p3950"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3950)">It had worked, he decided, when Bren Adahan sat back in his chair, clearly mollified.</p>
<a id="p3951" name="p3951"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3951)">*No, it didn't. What worked is that I just relayed privately, on your behalf: "Sorry I'm such a jerk; I'll apologize later&#151;would you and Aeia meet me for a drink after the council?"*</p>
<a id="p3952" name="p3952"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3952)">"The next item," Thomen said, "is the matter of the Heir's planned absence."</p>
<a id="p3953" name="p3953"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3953)">"If I may?" Ariken, the white-haired baron from Krathael, leaned forward, and continued at Thomen's consenting nod. "You have brought up an&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;important matter. This&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;leaving of yours we have been hearing about . . ." he said, in voice creaking with age. "I&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;respectfully, yes, always respectfully&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;counsel against it, and ask why you seem to find it necessary to leave at such a&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;difficult time. Until you've assumed the crown&#151;and your full duties&#151;it would seem, almost, perhaps irresponsible to leave the Empire, even for a short&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;period of time." He sat back hard in his chair, panting, his lined face ashen. "And it&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;does me good to see you, from time to time."</p>
<a id="p3954" name="p3954"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3954)"><i>Isn't there anything that can be done for him?&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3955" name="p3955"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3955)">*Have you a cure for old age?* There was nothing that could be done, either for the baron or the situation. Barony Krathael had been overrun by the Holts during the Holtun-Bieme war; the baron was fiercely devoted to Karl Cullinane, his rescuer, and to his heir. As long as he could run the barony adequately, it would both be and seem an act of rank ingratitude to force him to abdicate in favor of his son.</p>
<a id="p3956" name="p3956"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3956)">Arrifezh, the rapier-slim baron from Arondael, shook his head. "If he is going to spend time away, best to do so now. At least&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p3957" name="p3957"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3957)">"At least he isn't abandoning the Empire like his father did? Is that your charge, Baron Arondael?" Baron Nerahan put in. He was a cruel-looking man, his two shifty brown eyes staring out at the world from under heavy brows. His sharp nose and bristly mustache always reminded Jason of a rat's whiskers. During the Holtun-Bieme war, he had been directly responsible for incredible cruelties.</p>
<a id="p3958" name="p3958"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3958)">*But since then, as your father used to say, he's been a Boy Scout. And while he's still trying to rout Arondael, he's trying to do it as your follower, so you'd best treat him kindly.*</p>
<a id="p3959" name="p3959"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3959)">"Is that your charge?" Nerahan repeated. "Do you claim that the Emperor abandoned us?"</p>
<a id="p3960" name="p3960"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3960)">"It's <i>my </i>charge, if no one else has the nerve. <i>Yes!</i>" Tyrnael slammed his hand down on the table, dismissing Tennetty with a snort when she let her hand drop to the butt of a pistol. His chin set stubbornly, Listar Tyrnael tossed his head, clearing his unruly black hair from his eyes. "He abandoned us. His responsibilities were here, with us. He was the Emperor."</p>
<a id="p3961" name="p3961"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3961)">"Baron," Thomen said, his voice cutting through the murmurs. He pursed his lips, then drummed his fingers on the timeworn surface of the table. "It was his decision, not yours, and not mine. He paid in full for his decision, and did his best to see that we don't have to. Let it be."</p>
<a id="p3962" name="p3962"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3962)">Tyrnael wasn't inclined to let matters rest there. "There's a lesson in this, and I&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3963" name="p3963"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3963)">"Baron, please." Bren Adahan spoke up. "He's right. For the sake of the realm, let it be."</p>
<a id="p3964" name="p3964"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3964)">At Nerahan's nod, Arondael's brow wrinkled.</p>
<a id="p3965" name="p3965"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3965)">"And," Thomen Furnael went on, "as to the Heir traveling to Home now, I do have a bit of news that might affect your views on that. But there are some matters to discuss first."</p>
<a id="p3966" name="p3966"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3966)">Tyrnael, still visibly bothered, subsided.</p>
<a id="p3967" name="p3967"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3967)">Kevalun, the military governor of Irulahan, sat forward at that. Perhaps he'd caught something in Thomen's manner. "News, Baron?" he asked, perhaps a touch urgently. It would have been easy to think of young-looking Kevalun as almost a contemporary, Jason reminded himself, but the general was into his fifties. In fact, Kevalun had a son in his thirties, and a daughter of about sixteen&#151;a rather attractive daughter of about sixteen.</p>
<a id="p3968" name="p3968"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3968)">*Just keep it in your pants and listen up.*</p>
<a id="p3969" name="p3969"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3969)">"News, General. In good time, we'll get to it. Before we discuss the Home issues, and the matter of the Heir's trip," Thomen went on, "we have several items to go over on the agenda. Let's get to it."</p>
<a id="p3970" name="p3970"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3970)">The first item was the progress of the removal of Imperial troops from barony Nerahan, and the return of the barony to civilian rule. Predictably, the transfer of power was proceeding too slowly to suit the Nerahans and the Holts, and was both proceeding too quickly and was too abrupt to suit most of the Biemish.</p>
<a id="p3971" name="p3971"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3971)">After that, matters turned to appropriations: Ranella and Bren Adahan argued forcefully for increased development in the Little Pittsburgh steel facilities, while Thomen formally recused himself, on grounds of conflict of interest: the plant, although near the Adahan border, was in Furnael.</p>
<a id="p3972" name="p3972"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3972)">The consensus, surprisingly enough, was to spend the required money.</p>
<a id="p3973" name="p3973"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3973)">*Not really surprising. Thomen's had bowies, made from samples of the new batch of steel, sent to each of the barons. It's good stuff, almost the quality of Home wootz. The promise of an endless supply of it, cheap, is worth some investment.*</p>
<a id="p3974" name="p3974"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3974)">That led to the question of the railroad. While the barons had been almost unanimous in their approval of increased spending on the steel plant, they were&#151;with the sole exceptions of Thomen and Bren Adahan&#151;completely united in their opposition to any excessive spending on what Terumel, Baron Derahan, referred to as "this dubious Engineer magic."</p>
<a id="p3975" name="p3975"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3975)">Ranella looked over at Jason. She was a thick, plain woman, whose hands were always nicked and stained from some set of experiments that hadn't gone quite as planned.</p>
<a id="p3976" name="p3976"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3976)">*She wants your support on this. Thomen thinks she's right, but he says that the barons aren't going to go for it.*</p>
<a id="p3977" name="p3977"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3977)">Jason stood. "I'm very much in favor of a railroad," he said. "Just as the roads hold Holtun and Bieme together and link the two, a railroad can do more."</p>
<a id="p3978" name="p3978"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3978)">"Yes, yes, yes," Arbert, Baron Irulahan said, dismissing the obvious with a wave. "But this will involve huge revenues&#151;tens of thousands of marks, just to start. When do we see the return on such an investment?"</p>
<a id="p3979" name="p3979"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3979)">General Garavar had sat silent so far; at this he stirred. "Immediately, if we build it correctly." He beckoned to his aide, who produced a map. "I've been giving this long and careful thought," he said as he spread the chart out on the table. It was a simple map of Holtun and Bieme and the surrounding countries. "Ranella wants to put the first line here, to link Biemestren and Little Pit-sa-burg," he went on, stumbling over the still-awkward English words. "There's much sense in that, surely; Biemestren is the capital. But I say we run it here, from Biemestren into barony Tyrnael, terminating here, at Kernat village."</p>
<a id="p3980" name="p3980"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3980)"><i>Kernat village. </i>The room fell silent. The matter of the Kernat village slaughter was not at all closed, despite Danagar's failure to fix the blame. Was it an attempt by the Slavers' Guild to provoke another war in the Middle Lands? Or was it a probe by Prince Pugeer of Nyphien, an attempt to see just how hard he could push the Empire before it pushed back?</p>
<a id="p3981" name="p3981"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3981)">"And the payoff?" Tyrnael raised an eyebrow.</p>
<a id="p3982" name="p3982"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3982)">"It's now a four day ride from Biemestren to Kernat village&#151;perhaps three days, if I push the men. They'll arrive tired, their horses tired, their fighting ability limited until they've had at least a good day's rest. If we had a railroad it would be a one-day trip, and the men and horses would arrive rested, ready to fight.</p>
<a id="p3983" name="p3983"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3983)">"Put the railroad here, and I can put the entire Home Guard, plus cannons, into Tyrnael, ready to strike into Nyphien or repel a strike, within a day." He paused to let that sink in. "Put spurs out, spanning the country, and not only can we trade with ourselves easier, faster, not only can we move steel and grain from one end of the Empire to the other, but we can move soldiers more quickly."</p>
<a id="p3984" name="p3984"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3984)">"It's still an&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;awful lot of money," Baron Krathael said. "There's land to be cleared, some of it in my barony. How will I be compensated for that?"</p>
<a id="p3985" name="p3985"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3985)">The conversation degenerated into a discussion of right-of-way. There had long been precedent for the throne, both in Holtun and in Bieme, declaring a right-of-way for the purpose of building military roads. The owner of the land was always to be compensated, but there was no clear precedent as to how much would be paid.</p>
<a id="p3986" name="p3986"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3986)">Karl Cullinane probably would have said something like, Precedent be damned&#151;we'll figure out a reasonable way to handle it and then implement it.&#160;</p>
<a id="p3987" name="p3987"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3987)">Ranella looked over at Jason. "If I may? A compromise: could I build just a demonstration line, run it from the castle out, say, half a day's ride? The local farmers could use it for bringing goods to market in Biemestren, and we could test its ability to move troops."</p>
<a id="p3988" name="p3988"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3988)">Jason knew that he should say something, but what could he say? Garavar and Ranella had made all the sound arguments; all that was left to Jason was pounding on the table, and that would have been silly.</p>
<a id="p3989" name="p3989"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3989)">Thomen took the initiative. "With the consent of the Heir, Engineer Ranella is authorized to build a demonstration railroad."</p>
<a id="p3990" name="p3990"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3990)">*Nod, please.*</p>
<a id="p3991" name="p3991"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3991)">Jason nodded. "I consent, of course."</p>
<a id="p3992" name="p3992"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3992)">Thomen looked down at the paper in front of him. "Next matter: Baron Nerahan has applied to have his soldiers trained with, and armed with, rifles. Baron Nerahan."</p>
<a id="p3993" name="p3993"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3993)">Nerahan rose, and made an impassioned plea. Jason would have been impressed with his depth of feeling&#151;if Ellegon hadn't told him that Nerahan had expected to have his request denied the first time around, and was merely laying the groundwork for a future, successful request. That surprised Jason&#151;that somebody might plead so hard for something he didn't expect to get was a bit bewildering.</p>
<a id="p3994" name="p3994"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3994)">Arondael, unsurprisingly, led the Biemish assault against Nerahan's request; the other barons' opposition was more <i>pro forma </i>than anything else. With one exception.</p>
<a id="p3995" name="p3995"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3995)">Thomen Furnael stood. "I'm speaking not as judge or regent now, but just as a member of this council." He paced the room as he spoke. "There are dangerous forces at work in the world. I'm not just speaking of the Nyphien problem, although we're going to have to face that soon enough, one way or another. I'm not just speaking of the rumors I've been hearing of late about strange things coming out of Faerie, either."</p>
<a id="p3996" name="p3996"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3996)"><i>Strange things? I hadn't heard anything.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p3997" name="p3997"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3997)">*Thomen has better sources of news than you do. Well, that's not true: he has the same sources of news, but he listens somewhat more carefully to them. He works a lot harder than some people I could name.*</p>
<a id="p3998" name="p3998"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3998)">Jason brushed the dig aside. <i>So, what's the news?</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p3999" name="p3999"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3999)">*Not much, not really. But there have been some bizarre killings around Ehvenor. The information isn't reliable, but there's talk of finding only the front halves of a string of six horses, the rear halves having been cleanly bitten off, and of finding dead humans, and of parts of dead humans, and of beasts that fly away like dragons, or other large creatures that run away, creatures that can't be seen when you look directly at them.* The dragon gave a mental shrug. *How much weight should be given to all of this is a good question. Rumors are completely false some of the time and largely false most often.*</p>
<a id="p4000" name="p4000"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4000)">Thomen was still speaking. "&#151;and part of that plan is to return as much of Holtun as possible to baronial rule as soon as possible. I understand that many of us aren't minded to trust Baron Nerahan, but I invite you all to consider the effect of not trusting him, not trusting any Holtish barons."</p>
<a id="p4001" name="p4001"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4001)">Baron Tyrnael nodded. "Given that, I'd prefer that we start this with Adahan, not Nerahan." Bren Adahan smiled tightly. "Baron Adahan has demonstrated his loyalty to the crown, and his&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. associations with the family are well known."</p>
<a id="p4002" name="p4002"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4002)">Aeia smiled tightly. "And what associations might those be, Baron?" Her voice was deceptively light, but Jason knew she was seething inside.</p>
<a id="p4003" name="p4003"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4003)">*Family trait: you Cullinanes don't like having your, err, affairs discussed in public.*</p>
<a id="p4004" name="p4004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4004)">Tyrnael smiled. "You two are always seen together, Lady. If you spurn his company, that would not be so. And if Baron Adahan has <i>not </i>asked you to marry him, then will I recommend to the Heir and regent that they take his barony away from him permanently, and give it to someone who is not a fool."</p>
<a id="p4005" name="p4005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4005)">"I'm not a fool," Bren Adahan said with a grin.</p>
<a id="p4006" name="p4006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4006)">"My point precisely."</p>
<a id="p4007" name="p4007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4007)">That pacified Aeia, although not Bren Adahan. "I'd rather&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;not resume day-to-day control over Adahan, not yet. For one thing, military government gives us a good reason to keep enough Imperial troops garrisoned near Little Pittsburgh to protect it, if necessary. For another, I've much to learn from the Engineer, and can't study with him while I'm in Adahan. 'For sage advice, go where the sage is'&#151;I intend to resume my studies at Home." He looked to Aeia for just a moment, then looked away.</p>
<a id="p4008" name="p4008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4008)">She nodded. "Think of what an engineer-baron is going to mean to Holtun, in the long run."</p>
<a id="p4009" name="p4009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4009)">A muscle twitched in Tyrnael's jaw. "I am."</p>
<a id="p4010" name="p4010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4010)">"Very well," Thomen said with a nod that dismissed Tyrnael's comment as a concession. "Which brings up the next matter, and it's something that you may find as distressing as I do." He produced a piece of paper. "We've received, via a Home trader, a letter from Lou Riccetti. The Engineer is talking about selling guns and powder to Therranj."</p>
