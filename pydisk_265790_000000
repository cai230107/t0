<h2 class="chapter">13 KOLDER NEST</h2>

<p>TIME WAS hard to measure in this ship&rsquo;s cell. Simon lay
relaxed on a narrow shelf bunk, but still he held to that ribbon of
communication which included not only Jaelithe, but now Loyse in a
lesser degree. Though the girl no longer shared his quarters, she
was present in his mind.</p>

<p>Simon had seen none of his captors since, shortly after this voyage had begun, Aldis appeared and took charge of
Loyse, leaving him alone. A second inspection of the narrow cabin
had provided some amenities: a bunk which could be pulled out and
down from the wall, a sliding shelf on which, from time to time, a
tray of food appeared&mdash;coming from the wall behind.</p>

<p>The food was emergency rations, he thought, thin wafers without
much taste, a small can of liquid. Not appetizing but enough to
keep hunger and thirst under control. Otherwise there was no break
in the long, silent hours. He did sleep a little while Loyse took
over, holding the tie. Simon gathered that she now shared
Aldis&rsquo; cabin, but that the Kolder agent was leaving her
alone, content that she was passive.</p>

<p>Seven, now eight mealtimes. Simon counted them off. But that
gave him no reasonable idea of the number of hours or days he had
been here under the unchanging glow of the walls. They could be
feeding him twice daily, or even once; he could not be sure. This
was a period of waiting, and to any man who had depended most of
his life upon the stimulation of action, waiting was a harsh
ordeal. Only once before had it been so&mdash;during a year in
jail. Waiting then, warped by the bitterness of knowing that he had
been duped into taking punishment for those he hated, he had spent
that time striving to work out schemes for repayment.</p>

<p>Now he was facing a blind future without even a good knowledge
of the nature of the enemy. All he had was that mental picture from
the past of the Kolder leader dying in Gorm, a narrow valley down
which strange vehicles dashed while those in them fired back at
pursuers. There had been another world for the Kolders and
something had gone wrong there.</p>

<p>Somehow they had discovered a &ldquo;gate&rdquo; and come
through&mdash;into this time and place, where the civilization of the Estcarpian Old Race was on the wane, a
slow slip into the age-old dust which already rose about
Es and the villages and cities of their kind. Along the
coast&mdash;in Alizon and Karsten&mdash;a more barbaric
upswing
was rooted, newer nations, elbowing aside the Old Race,
yet so much in awe of their legendary witches that
they dared not quite challenge them&mdash;not until the
Kolder began to meddle.</p>

<p>And if Kolder was not uprooted, Alizon and Karsten would go the
way of Gorm: ingested into the horror of the possessed. Yet Kolder
played upon this older enmity and fear to make their future victims
their present allies.</p>

<p>The nature of Kolder. Simon began to concentrate upon that.
Their native civilization was a mechanical, science-based
one&mdash;that fact had been amply proven by what they had found in
Gorm. The Estcarpian command had always believed that the Kolder
themselves must be few in number, that it was necessary for them to
have the possessed captives in order to keep their forces in the
field. And now that Gorm was gone and Yle evacuated&mdash;</p>

<p>Yle evacuated! Simon&rsquo;s eyes came open, he stared at the
ceiling of the cabin. How had he known that? Why was he so very
sure that the Kolder&rsquo;s only stronghold on the coast was now
an empty shell? Yet certain he was.</p>

<p>Were the Kolder now drawing in all their forces to protect their
base? Kolder manpower&mdash;there had been five left dead in Gorm,
the majority in their own apartments&mdash;not killed by any sword
or dart, but as if they had willed their own dying&mdash;or some
animating spark, common to all, had failed. But five! Could the
death of only five so weaken the Kolder cadre that they would have
to pull in all their garrisons?</p>

<p>Hundreds of the possessed had died in Gorm. And
then there were their agents in Karsten&mdash;Fulk&mdash;and
the
others such as Aldis who were still alive and about their
business. Not true Kolder, but natives who had come
to serve the enemy&mdash;not as mindless possessed, but
with wit and awareness. Not one of the Old Race could be so bent
to Kolder use; that was why the Old Race must go!</p>

<p>Again Simon wondered at whence that emphatic assertion had come.
They had known that the Kolder wanted no Old Race captives for
their ranks of possessed. They had suspected that this was the
reason, but now it was as clear in his mind as if he had had it
from Kolder lips.</p>

<p>Heard it? Did the Kolder have their form of communication such
as that he now held with Jaelithe and Loyse? That thought shook
him. Quickly Simon sent a warning to she who followed and caught
her unease in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are sure of the course now,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break. Do not send again unless there is great
need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great need . . .&rdquo; That echoed in his mind, and then
Simon became aware that the vibration which had been so steady in
the walls about him was muted, humming down scale as if the speed
they had maintained was being cut. Had they reached their port?</p>

<p>Simon sat up on the bunk, faced the door. Would they lock him
with the same stiff control which had kept him prisoner before? He
had no weapons, though some skill in unarmed combat. But he hardly
thought that the Kolder would try a scuffle man to man.</p>

<p>He was right, even as the door to the cabin opened, the freeze
was on him. He could move&mdash;by another&rsquo;s will&mdash;and
he did, out into the narrow corridor.</p>

<p>Men there, two of them. But looking into their eyes Simon
controlled a shudder only because he could not move save an order.
These were possessed, the dead-alive of the Kolder labor horde. One
was Sulcar by his fair head, his height; the other of the same
yellow-brown skinned race as the officer who had brought Simon on
board.</p>

<p>They did not touch him, merely waited, their soulless
gaze on him. One turned and started along the passage,
the other flattened back against the wall to allow Simon by,
and then fell in behind him. Thus, between the two, he climbed the
ladder, came out on the surface of the submarine.</p>

<p>Above was an arch of rock. The water lapped sullenly against a
waiting quay and Simon saw here a likeness to the hidden port
beneath Sippar, evidently a familiar pattern for the enemy. Still
moved by remote control he walked ashore on the narrow gangway.
There was activity there. Gangs of almost-naked possessed shifted
boxes, cleared spaces. They worked steadily, as if each man knew
just what was to be done, and the quickest way of doing it.</p>

<p>No voices raised, no talk among the work gang. Simon stalked
stiffly behind his guide, the Sulcar bringing up the rear, and no
one looked at them. The quay was long and two other subs nosed
against it. Being unloaded, Simon noted. Signs of withdrawal from
other posts?</p>

<p>Before them were two exits, a tunnel and a flight of stairs to
the left. His guide took that way. Five steps and then a waiting
cubby. Once they were inside the door closed and they arose in an
elevator such as had been in Sippar.</p>

<p>The ride was not long, the door slid open upon a corridor.
Sleek gray walls with a metallic luster to their surfaces, outlines
of doors, all closed. They passed six, three to a side, before they
came to the end of the hall and a door which was open.</p>

<p>Simon had been in the heart center of Sippar and he half
expected to see here again the seated Kolder, the capped master at
a cross table, all the controls those men had run to hold their
defenses tight.</p>

<p>But this was a much smaller room than that. Light, a
harsh burst of it, came from bars set in the ceiling in a
complicated geometric pattern Simon had no desire to
examine closely. The floor had no discernible carpeting,
yet it yielded to cushion their steps. There were three
chairs, curved back and seat in one piece. And in the center one
a true Kolder.</p>

<p>Simon&rsquo;s guards had not entered with him, but that
compulsion which had brought him out of the submarine now marched
him forward a step or two to face the Kolder officer. The
alien&rsquo;s smock-like over garment was the same gray as the
chair in which he sat, as the walls and the flooring. Only his
skin, pallid, bleached to a paper white, broke that general
monotone of color. Most of his head was covered by a skullcap, and
as far as Simon could see, he had no hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here at last.&rdquo; The mumble of an alien
tongue and yet Simon somehow understood the words. Their meaning
surprised him a little, one could almost believe that they were not
captor and prisoner but two who had some bargain in prospect and
needed only to come to a final agreement. Caution kept Simon
silent&mdash;the Kolder must reveal his game first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Thurhu send you?&rdquo; The Kolder continued to study
Simon and now the other thought that there was a spark of doubt in
that question. &ldquo;But you are not an outer one!&rdquo; The
doubt flared into hostility. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon Tregarth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kolder continued to hold him with a narrowed stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not one of these natives.&rdquo; No question but
an assured statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore you have come from beyond. But you are not an
outer one, and certainly not of the true breed. I ask you
now&mdash;what are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man from another world, or perhaps another time,&rdquo;
Simon saw no reason not to tell the truth. Perhaps the fact that he
was a puzzle for the Kolder was to his advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What world? What time?&rdquo; Those shot at him
harshly.</p>

<p>Simon could neither shake his head nor shrug. But he put his own
ignorance into words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own world and time. Its relation to this one I do not
know. There was a way opened and I came through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did you journey so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To escape enemies.&rdquo; Even as you and yours did,
Simon added in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had been a war,&rdquo; Simon corrected. &ldquo;I
was a
soldier, but in peace I was not necessary. I had private
enemies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A soldier,&rdquo; the Kolder officer repeated, still
appraising him with that unchanging stare. &ldquo;And now you
fight for these witches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fighting is my trade. I took service with them,
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet these natives are barbarians, and you are a civilized
man. Oh, show no surprise at my guess, does not like always
recognize like? We, too, are soldiers and our war brought us
defeat. Only it has also brought us victory in the end since we are
here and we hold that which shall make this world ours! Think you
on that, outsider. A whole world to lie thus&mdash;&rdquo; He
stretched forth his hand, palm up, and then closed his fingers
slowly as if he balled something tangible within his fist.
&ldquo;To serve as you will it! These natives cannot stand against
what we have to back us. And&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and then added
with slow and telling emphasis, &ldquo;we can use such a man as
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that why I am a prisoner here?&rdquo; Simon
countered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But not to remain a prisoner&mdash;unless you will
it. Simon Tregarth, March Warder of the south. Ah, we know you
all&mdash;the mighty of Estcarp.&rdquo; His expression did not
change, but there was a sneer in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your witch wife now, March Warder&mdash;back
with those other she-devils? It did not take her long to learn that
you had nothing she cared to possess, did it? Oh, all that passes in Estcarp, Karsten and Alizon is
known to us, to the minutest detail it is known. We can
possess you if we wish. But we shall give you a choice, Simon
Tregarth. You owe nothing to those she-devils of Estcarp, to the
wandering-witted barbarians they control with their magic. Has not
that witch of yours proved to you that there can be no loyalty with
them? So we say&mdash;come with us, work in our grand plan. Then Estcarp
will lie open for your plucking, your terms&mdash;or strike any
other bargain you wish. Be March Warder again, do as Estcarp
wishes, until the word comes to do otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I do not accept?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a pity to waste one of your potential. But he
who is not with us is against us, and we can always use a strong
back, legs, arms to labor here. You have already tasted what we can
do&mdash;your muscles do not obey you now, and you cannot take a
step unless we will it so. This can be used otherwise. Would you
care to breathe only by our favor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sudden constriction about Simon&rsquo;s chest. He
gasped under that squeezing pressure and panic awoke in him. Less
than a second, but the fear did not leave him when he was released.
He did not in the least doubt that the Kolder could do as was
threatened&mdash;keep the air from his lungs, if they chose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why. . . bargain?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the agents we wish cannot be forced. Under
such controls you must be constantly checked and
watched, you would not so serve our purpose. Accept
freely and you will be free&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within your limits,&rdquo; Simon returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. Within our limits, and that will remain so. Do
not believe that you can give assent with your lips and keep to
your own purpose thereafter. There will be a change in you, but you
will retain your mind, your personality, such of your desires and
wishes as fit within the framework of our overall plan. You will
not be only flesh to carry out orders as those you term possessed
and you will not be dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I must choose now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Kolder did not answer at once. Again his expression was
blank, but Simon caught a faint tinge of meaning in his
voice&mdash;threat, uncertainty, maybe one and the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no signal which Simon could distinguish but the control
brought him about, set him walking. No guards this time, but they
were not needed. There was no possible way for Simon to break free,
and the threat of constriction about his chest was with him still,
so that every time he thought of that he had the need to breathe
deeply.</p>

<p>Down the corridor, into the elevator again. Up, an open door;
the order to move, another hall and another door. Simon went into
the room beyond and the control was gone. He turned quickly, but
the door was closed and he did not need to try it to know that it
would not open.</p>

<p>The harsh, artificial light of the lower room was gone. Two slit
windows were open to the day and Simon went to the nearest. He was
in a position of some height above a rocky coastline with a sheer
descent to water. By side glimpses he got an idea of the building;
it must resemble Yle. Not only was the window slit too narrow to
climb through, but there was no way down, save that drop straight
to the sea-washed rocks.</p>

<p>Simon crossed to the other window. Bare rocks again, not the
slightest sign of vegetation&mdash;rocks in wind-worn pinnacles, in
table mesas, slashed into sharp-walled canyons and drops. It was
the most forbidding stretch of natural territory he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Movement. Simon pushed forward as far as he could
in the window slit to see what moved in that tormented
wilderness of broken rock. A land machine of some sort,
not unlike a truck of his own world, though it progressed
on caterpillar tracks, which crunched and flattened the
surface at a pace, Simon judged, hardly faster than a
brisk walk. There were marks on that surface which the
machine followed. This was not the first truck which had gone
that way, or perhaps not the first trip this one had made in the
same direction.</p>

<p>It had a full cargo, and clinging to that lashed-on gear were
four men, their ragged scraps of clothing labeling them slave
laborers. The machine lurched and jerked so that they held with
both hands and feet. That slow crawl inland with a cargo on board.
Simon continued to watch until the truck disappeared behind a mesa.
It was only then that he turned to examine his new prison.</p>

<p>Monotone color and a bed which was merely a shelf opening from
the wall and covered by a puffed, foamy substance. Closed doors of
cupboards&mdash;a whole row of them. One upon his investigating
turned down into a table, another gave him sanitary arrangements as
there had been on the submarine. The rest remained tightly closed.
It was a room to induce boredom, Simon thought. Perhaps its very
monotony was a piece of careful contrivance.</p>

<p>But there was one thing he was sure of: this was the Kolder
base. And there was a good chance that they might have him under
some form of observation. The fact that he had been released from
control might even be because they wished to see how he would use
his freedom. Could they suspect the tie? Was he bait in a trap to
bring in Jaelithe?</p>

<p>What would the Kolder give to have one of the witches in their
hands? Simon thought that under the circumstances they would give
a great deal. Suppose that everything&mdash;everything&mdash;which
had happened to him since the awakening in Tormarsh when he had
found Jaelithe again had really been of their engineering! He could
not be sure it was not.</p>

<p>Yet the Kolder depended upon their machines. They affected to
despise the power. So had they any way of detecting what Simon,
Jaelithe and Loyse had woven? To contact Jaelithe now . . . would
it be right or wrong?</p>

<p>Betrayal or report? He had promised to let her know when he reached the base, give her the news which would
eventually summon Estcarp. But how long would it take to bring in
that armada? And what could darts and swords or even the power do
against the weapons the Kolder must mount here&mdash;things which
had not perhaps been in Gorm or Yle? Should he call or stay
silent?</p>

<p>More movement. A truck crawling back. Was it the same vehicle he
had watched depart? But that hardly would have time to unload and
this was empty.</p>

<p>Call&mdash;or be silent? Simon could no longer use this useless
survey of the land as an excuse for not making up his mind. He went
to the bed, lay down upon it. A chance&mdash;but everything was a
chance now, and if this was not betrayal, then he dared not
delay.</p>
