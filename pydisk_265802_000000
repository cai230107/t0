<h2 class="chapter">6 DUCHESS OF KARSTEN</h2>

<p>LOYSE SAT on the wide bed with her knees drawn up, her arms
clasped around them, her eyes for that naked blade resting before
her. What was Aldis&rsquo; purpose? It could not be that the
duke&rsquo;s mistress thought she would lose her power over Yvian.
His need for Loyse was one of expediency only. And Aldis who had
ruled him so long would not be easily unseated.</p>

<p>But&mdash;Loyse&rsquo;s tongue tip ran along dry lips as she
remembered. When Jaelithe had been a seeress in Kars
months ago, Aldis had come to her secretly, to buy a
spell to keep Yvian truly hers. And she must have believed in the necessity and efficiency of that or she
would not have come. Then, in that later battle of wills
&mdash;when the Guardians had used the most potent sendings
they could conjure&mdash;Aldis (by image) had been the target of
Jaelithe&rsquo;s attack. By all the arts of Estcarp certain
temporary commands had then been planted in her to use her
influence upon Yvian to further the witches&rsquo; desires.</p>

<p>Now Loyse could not reconcile this present Aldis with the one
she had so long thought upon. This Aldis would not have sought out
Jaelithe, save for a contest of strengths. Had that been the real
purpose of that visit to the witch of Estcarp? No! Jaelithe&rsquo;s
own power would have revealed to her any such plan behind
Aldis&rsquo; seeking. She had then come honestly for her love
potion.</p>

<p>And it was the truth that Aldis had been put under control for a
period at the battle of wills before the taking of Gorm, even
though that had been done from a distance and through images only.
A failure there, too, Jaelithe would have known immediately.</p>

<p>Loyse gnawed on her lower lip and continued to stare at the
dagger. She herself had failed in meeting with the duke&rsquo;s
leman&mdash;she had been too assured when she should have been
simple and bewildered. Somehow she had been turned inside out,
assessed, by opposition she must respect&mdash;or fear? Aldis was
not Aldis as she had expected her to be. And now, Aldis was playing
some game of her own, in which she considered Loyse to be a piece
to be moved at her pleasure.</p>

<p>Patiently the girl fought down both hot anger and the tinge of
fear which followed the facing of that fact. Ostensibly she had
been brought out of Estcarp because she was Yvian&rsquo;s wife by
ax marriage. What did Yvian gain by her coming? First, what he had
wanted from the beginning&mdash;Verlaine with its sea-brought
treasure, its fortress, its lower harbor which, with the reef
knowledge of its men, would give him a fine raiding port from which
to prey on Estcarp.</p>

<p>Second, she was of the old nobility, and perhaps that
fact might reconcile the aloof houses to Yvian. The tales
out of Kars were that he desired to cut old ties with
the mercenaries, establish his ducal throne more firmly by
uniting with the rulers of the past.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Loyse hugged her knees more tightly&mdash;third, her
flight from Verlaine, her joining with his enemies in Estcarp, must
have been a goad to personal anger and a wound to his self-esteem.
And&mdash;those few hints from Aldis&mdash;perhaps he chewed now
upon the fact that she had sworn betrothal with Koris, that she
preferred the outcast of Gorm to the Duke of Karsten. Her lips
curled; as if there could be any question between them! Koris was .
. . Koris! All she had ever wanted or could want in her life!</p>

<p>Three reasons to bring her here, yet behind them she sensed a
shadowy fourth. And, sitting there in the gray of dawn, Loyse tried
to summon it into the open. Not Yvian&rsquo;s reason, but Aldis&rsquo;?
And why she was sure of that she could not have told either, but
that it was true she had no doubt at all.</p>

<p>What could be Aldis&rsquo; reason? To bring her here, frighten
her with those threats of what Yvian had in mind for her&mdash;and
then deliver into her hand a weapon. So that she might turn that
against herself, thus disposing for all time of a rival? A surface
reason that, but one which did not quite fit. So that Loyse might
turn this length of fine polished metal against the duke when he
would have his will of her? But Yvian was Aldis&rsquo; hold on what
she wanted&mdash;personal power within the duchy! At any rate
Aldis&rsquo; gift must be considered carefully.</p>

<p>Loyse slid from the bed and went to throw open the window
shutters, allowing the wind to sweep across her face, freshen her
dully aching head. She thought that it might be mountain wind,
though it must have crossed long leagues to be from there. There
was a harsh strength to it which she needed to beat against her
now.</p>

<p>Somewhere they must be on the move&mdash;Koris, Simon,
Jaelithe. Loyse did not doubt in the least that they
were seeking her. But that they could reach into Kars
she did not think possible. No&mdash;once more her future
depended upon her own resources and wits. She went back to the
bed and took up the dagger. Aldis&rsquo; gift might be in some way
a trap, but Loyse knew relief as her fingers closed about the
weapon&rsquo;s chill hilt.</p>

<p>Her eyelids were heavy, she dropped back against the bed. Sleep
. . . she must have sleep. The table across the door once more? But
she could not summon the energy to pull away from the bed and place
it so. With the mountain air freshening the room she slept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was those months she had spent campaigning in the
border mountains, the need to be alert even in sleep, which had
given her that guardian sense. Somewhere in the depths of
exhaustion a warning sounded, so that Loyse was out of slumber and
awake, though she lay for a long moment with closed
eyes&mdash;listening, striving with every part of her to learn
what chanced.</p>

<p>The faint protest of a hinge&mdash;the door! Loyse jerked
upright amidst the tumbled covers of the bed. There was morning sun
from the window she had left open. The rest of the room was dusky
with shadows to which her eyes were more accustomed than were those
of the man who entered.</p>

<p>Loyse scrambled to the side of the bed, plunged down, ignoring
the dais steps, and put the wide expanse of that massive piece of
furniture between her and the invader who had turned his back
almost contemptuously as he put the key to lock, this time on the
inner side of the door.</p>

<p>He was big&mdash;as tall as Simon&mdash;and his width of
shoulder was not lessened by the folds of his loose bedgown. Big
and probably as strong as Koris into the bargain. As he turned to
face her with that assured leisureliness, she saw he was smiling a
little. And to her mind it was a very cruel and evil smile.</p>

<p>In a way he was like Fulk, but with her father&rsquo;s vivid
red-gold coloring blurred into drabber sandiness, the
clean cut features coarsened, a scar seam along his jaw
line adding an ugly touch. Yvian the mercenary, Yvian the
undefeated.</p>

<p>Loyse, her back now against the stone wall, thought that Duke
Yvian no longer believed that defeat could ever touch him. And that
complete self-confidence was in itself a daunting thing to
face.</p>

<p>He crossed, with no hurry, to the end of the bed and stood
watching her, his smile growing broader. Then he bowed with a
mockery bolder than that Aldis had used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We meet at last, my lady. A meeting too long
delayed&mdash;at least I have found it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He surveyed her with some of the same contempt Fulk had used to
batter her in the past. &ldquo;A whey-faced stick indeed.&rdquo; Yvian nodded as if
confirming a report. &ldquo;You have naught to pride yourself
upon, my lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To answer&mdash;would that provoke him into action? Or could
silence be a small defense? Loyse wavered between two courses. The
longer he talked, the more of a breathing space she had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, no man would choose you for your face, Loyse of
Verlaine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was he trying to goad her into some protest or reply? Loyse watched him narrowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Statecraft,&rdquo; Yvian laughed, &ldquo;statecraft can
drive a man
to many things which would otherwise knot his stomach
in disgust. So I wed you and now I bed you, lady of
Verlaine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not lunge for her as she feared he might, but advanced
deliberately. And Loyse, edging away from him along the wall, read
his reason in his eyes. The chase and the capture&mdash;that
inevitable capture&mdash;would provide him with amusement. And, she
thought, he would prolong his pursuit of her, savoring her fear,
faint hopes born from continued evasion, as long as he wished. Then
when he tired, the end would come&mdash;at his time and on his
terms!</p>

<p>So much would she humor him. With the agility she had learned
among the Borderers Loyse leaped, not for the locked door as Yvian
might have anticipated, but for the surface of the bed. He had not
expected that and his clutch at her fell far short. She sprang
again, aided in part by the elasticity of the hide lashings which
supported the mattress. Her hands caught the cross ties meant to
hold the canopy of state and hangings. Somehow she pulled herself
up, perched there, drawing sobbing breaths from the effort which
left her momentarily weak, but well above Yvian&rsquo;s reach.</p>

<p>He stared at her. No laughter, no smile now. His eyes narrowed
as they must through the visor of his war helm as he looked out
upon a battle.</p>

<p>No more talking, he was all purpose. But Loyse doubted if he
could climb to rake her down. His weight must be almost double hers
and the dusty strips on which she crouched were already creaking
when she shifted position. After a long moment Yvian must have
agreed on that. His fists closed about a heavy poster of the bed
and he began to exert strength against that. Wood creaked, dust
sifted into the air. The breath came out of Yvian&rsquo;s chest in
heavy grunts. He had been softened by good living, but he still
had the frame of a man who had killed more than one in camp
wrestling.</p>

<p>The post was yielding and now he pulled at it with short jerks,
right and left, loosening it in the bed frame while Loyse&rsquo;s
frail perch shook back and forth under her, and only the
finger-whitening grip she kept on the timbers held her safe. Then,
with a splintering crack, the post broke forward and Yvian stumbled
back. Loyse was thrown toward the floor. And the man who had
regained his balance with a swordsman&rsquo;s quick double step was
waiting for her, the grin back on his sweating face.</p>

<p>She threw herself sidewise as she came and this time
she had Aldis&rsquo; gift ready. Her shoulder met the
standing
post of the bed painfully, but, even as she cried out,
Loyse slashed with the dagger at the hands reaching to crush
her. Yvian snarled and dodged that stab. His robe caught in the
splintered end of a broken cross piece which sagged across the bed
and for a vital second he was a prisoner. He kicked at the girl
viciously, but Loyse scrambled to put the bed again between
them.</p>

<p>Yvian jerked his arm free. There was a moist white fleck at the
corner of his now pinched lips and his eyes . . . Loyse held the
dagger breast high and point out, her left arm still numb from the
blow against the post. If she had been hampered by skirts she could
never have kept out of his hands, but in riding clothes she was
limb free and as agile as any boy. Sword play she knew in part, but
knife fighting was an unlearned art. And she was facing a man not
only proven in battle, but lessoned in every kind of
rough-and-tumble known to blank shields.</p>

<p>He snatched up a draggled sheet from the bed and snapped it at
her viciously as a drover would snap a whip. The edge cut her
cheek, brought a second cry of pain out of her. But though she gave
ground, she did not drop her weapon. Again Yvian lashed at her, and
followed that by a lunge, his arms out and ready to engulf her
wholly.</p>

<p>It was the table which saved her then. She half fell, half
slipped about its end, while Yvian came up against it, taking the
full force of that bruising meeting on his thigh, the jar of it
slowing him. He found the loose robe hampering and suddenly
stopped, fumbling with its belt, striving to throw it off.</p>

<p>His eyes widened, set in a stare aimed across Loyse&rsquo;s
hunched shoulder. That device was so old&mdash;Loyse&rsquo;s
mouth twisted wryly&mdash;did he think to catch her in so
simple a net? So thinking she was unprepared for the
fierce grip which caught her upper arm, pulling her
back. There was a strong musky scent, a softness of silken
robe against her wrist. Then a white hand slipped down
her arm, twisted the knife from Loyse&rsquo;s hand as if she had
no strength at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you had not the nerve to kill.&rdquo; Aldis&rsquo;
voice. &ldquo;Well, let one who has use this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yvian&rsquo;s amazement was now a black scowl. He stood away
from the table to take a quick stride forward. Then he stumbled,
gathered balance and came on, in spite of the steel in his middle,
the stain growing on his robe. His hands clutched for Loyse. She
summoned up the last of her strength to thrust him away.
Surprisingly that shove from her made him stagger back and fall
against the bed, where he lay tearing at the covers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;?&rdquo; Loyse looked at Aldis where she now
stood bending over Yvian, watching him with a compelling intentness
as if willing him to show any remaining signs of opposition.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;?&rdquo; Loyse could get out no more than that one
word.</p>

<p>Aldis straightened, went to the half-open door. She paid no
attention to Loyse, her attitude was one of listening. Now the
girl could hear it, too&mdash;a pounding somewhere below, muffled
shouts. Aldis retreated with swift running steps and her hand was
again about Loyse&rsquo;s wrist, but this time not to disarm but to
pull the girl with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loyse tried to free herself. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Aldis&rsquo; face was thrust close to hers.
&ldquo;Those are Yvian&rsquo;s bodyguards breaking in below. Do you
want them to find you here&mdash;with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loyse was dazed. Aldis had thrown the knife which
had wounded the duke, and his bodyguard were striving
to force their way into his chambers. Why and why and
why? Because she could read no meaning into any of
this, she did not resist again as Aldis dragged her to the
door. The Karstenian&rsquo;s whole body expressed the need
for haste, the unease. And to know that Aldis shared
fear made it worse for Loyse. To know the enemy was
one thing, to be totally caught up in chaos was infinitely
worse.</p>

<p>They were in a small hall and the shouting below was louder.
Aldis pulled her on into the facing chamber. Long windows opened
upon a balcony and Loyse caught glimpses of luxurious furnishings.
This must be Aldis&rsquo; own room. But the other did not pause.
Onto the balcony they went and there faced a plank set across to a
neighboring balcony on the opposite wall. Aldis pushed Loyse
against the railing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; she ordered tersely, &ldquo;and
walk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo; The plank hung over nothingness. Loyse
dared not look down, but she sensed a long drop.</p>

<p>Aldis regarded her for a long moment and then brought her hand
up to her breast. She gripped a brooch there as if gaining by that
touch additional strength to rule Loyse by her will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk!&rdquo; she snapped again.</p>

<p>And Loyse discovered that it was as it had been with Berthora,
she was not in command of her body any more. Instead, that which
was she appeared to withdraw into some far place from which that
identity watched herself climb to the plank and walk across the
drop to the other balcony. And there she remained, still in that
spell, while Aldis followed. The Karstenian pushed aside their
frail bridge so that it fell out and down, closing the passage
behind them.</p>

<p>She, did not touch Loyse again, there was no need to. For the
girl could not throw off the bonds that held her to Aldis&rsquo;
desire. They went together through another room and then into a
wider chamber. A wounded man crawled there on his hands and knees.
But, his head hanging, he did not see them as Aldis swept her
captive on, both of them running now.</p>

<p>Loyse saw other wounded and dead, even the swirl
of small fighting groups, but none took any notice of
the two women. What had happened? Estcarp? Koris,
Simon&mdash;had they come for her? But all those they saw
locked in combat were Karsten badges, as if the forces of the
duke had split in civil war.</p>

<p>They reached the vast kitchens, to find those deserted, though
meat crackled on the spits, pots boiled and pans held contents
which were burning. And from there they came through a small
courtyard into a garden of sorts with straight rows of vegetables
and some trees already heavy with fruit.</p>

<p>Aldis pulled the long skirt of her outer robe up over her
forearm as she ran. Once she stopped when a tree branch caught in
her jeweled hair net, to break it, but a portion of the twig still
stuck out of the net. That she had a definite goal in mind Loyse
was sure, but what it might be she did not know until they were
splashing among reeds at the borders of a stream. There was a skiff
there and Aldis motioned to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in, lie down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loyse could only obey, the wash of water wetting through her
breeches, over the tops of her boots. Aldis scrambled in and the
skiff rocked with her movements as she huddled beside Loyse,
pulling over the both of them a musty smelling strip of woven
rushes. Moments later Loyse felt the boat move ahead, they were
being pulled along by the current, probably toward the river
dividing Kars.</p>

<p>The smell of the matting was faintly sickening, and the water
washing in the bottom of the boat had a swamp stench to it. Loyse
longed to lift her head and breathe clean air again. But there was
no disobeying Aldis&rsquo; orders. Her mind might rage, but her
body obeyed.</p>

<p>As the skiff bobbed on Loyse heard sounds which
meant they had reached the river. Now where was Aldis
going? When she had ridden with Berthora she had accepted all their actions as right and normal, had been
so ensorcelled that she had not feared or understood
what she was doing. But this time she knew that she
was under a spell which would make her do just as
Aldis wished. But why&mdash;why for everything which had
happened to her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Aldis&rsquo; voice soft close to her ear.
&ldquo;You ask why? But now you are duchess, my lady, all this
city, all the countryside beyond is yours! Can you understand what
that means, my little nothing out of nowhere at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loyse tried, she tried very hard to understand but she could
not.</p>

<p>There came a hail and Aldis sat up, the matting falling away so
that the river air was on them. The rounded side of a ship rose not
too far away, and Aldis was reaching for a rope tossed to them
from that vessel.</p>
