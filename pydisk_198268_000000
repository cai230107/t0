             "Going to get `nasty'," Sandra said as the Diana passed  be-
        tween  the fingers of land into the bay beyond.  To  the  "north" 
        was  Dularn, to the "south" was Orgon, a part of the Empire.   It 
        is called "Salmon Bay" in this era, but was known as Gray's  Har-
        bor  back in the 20th Century.  What was once the little city  of 
        Aberdeen now is only ruins caused by the aftermath of The War  of 
        2047.   There are several fishing villages and a lumbermill,  but 
        nothing of a major size.  There was once a large Imperial encamp-
        ment here, but that was abandoned after the Treaty of Arsana...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Ships  at  anchor  to the south," the  midshipman  on  duty 
        called  down  through  the open hatch that lead  to  the  forward 
        quickfirer turret.  "Looks like an Imperial fleet of some sort!"
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Same bunch we met up there to the north when Darlanis got a 
        bit `sticky' about things," Sandra announced, using a  telescope.  
        Obviously  they had made repairs and had come this far south  be-
        fore coming earlier to this bay to "hide" from the storm outside.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I suggest that we make sure we stay on the `Dularnian' side 
        of the bay," Carol spoke, her tone that of the Warlady of Dularn.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Imperial  ships are signaling one another, the galleys  are 
        taking down their masts!" the midshipman yelled down at us then!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Battle  Stations!" I snapped, pulling the lever  that  sent 
        the  warning signal through the ship.  The hatches  being  closed 
        down the Diana's flanks, Sandra going to the control room hatches 
        and closing them, the Diana now coming to full battle readiness!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "How  deep is the water here?" Carol asked, interrupting  my 
        train of thought.  That could be a "problem" right here too now!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There's  plenty  of water, no problems there,"  Sandra  an-
        swered, the Diana now swinging around to face her possible enemy.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We're not at war with the Empire," Carol said to me then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Someone forgot to tell them that, your `ladyship',"  Sandra 
        replied back, her blonde hair like a halo around her head in  the 
        half light of the interior of the control cabin.  It was  growing 
        dark outside, the lightning flashing in the sky to the west now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "As long as they stay where they are, we will do the  same," 
        Carol answered, her voice level, that of the Warlady of Dularn.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We will however keep steam up on all three boilers," I  ad-
        ded, seeing my wife nod.  We could hold our position with the en-
        gines.   While the interior of the Diana might get a bit  "uncom-
        fortable"  all "buttoned up" as we were, I saw no other  alterna-
        tive right now until we found out what the Imperials were up to.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  will require a boat, half a dozen men to row it,"  Carol 
        said  then, the tone of her voice leaving no doubts that she  was 
        planning to be rowed over to the Imperial fleet gathered there...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Not `good' being out in a storm like this, your  ladyship," 
        one of the oarsmen said to my wife as they rowed her over towards 
        the  waiting  Imperial  fleet, her  ornate  uniform  now  covered 
        against the coming rain by a raincoat.  The lightning flashing in 
        the sky overhead, the droplets of rain driven by the growing wind 
        all spoke of danger.  Carol was well aware that an open boat like 
        this was not the safest place to be in a thunderstorm, but it was 
        a "risk" she was willing to take if she could prevent a conflict.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I suggest you save your breath and put your backs into it," 
        Carol "smiled" back, the boat already rolling there in the waves.  
        The slap of the waves now throwing a bit of spray into the boat.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Aye, aye, my lady," the sailor muttered, doing so then.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Carol leaped up from the gunwale of the Diana's boat,  dash-
        ing  up the slippery rain wetted gangway, aware of the  faces  of 
        the men staring down at her.  The crack of the lightning and  the 
        rumble  of  the thunder like great guns adding a  bit  of  "back-
        ground" to the scene that she would have happily done without...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I am Carol Simmons, Warlady of Dularn," Carol spoke as  she 
        stepped aboard Sarnian Queen, the preparations for battle  aboard 
        the big steam frigate leaving no doubts now as to the  Imperial's 
        plans.  The Imperial admiral nodding, standing there in the rain, 
        the water now dripping from his hat, his raincoat.  He was an ol-
        der man, no doubt one well experienced in the "ways" of the  sea.  
        She was very much "aware" of the fact that she was but one  woman 
        among hostile men.  Men who often viewed women in terms of chains 
        and  slave  collars.  Only the "caste codes" and  the  system  of 
        "honor" of this era protected her now, not the blade at her hip!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "`Heard' of you," the Imperial admiral answered in reply.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We  are here at the request of your Empress," Carol  spoke, 
        reaching under her raincoat for the orders from Darlanis herself.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Come below," he answered, the rain pouring down upon them.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Seems `odd' that you'd help us now," the admiral said, giv-
        ing the documents back to my brownette as she sipped at her wine.  
        A slave girl, clad in the common short brief shift of the  Empire 
        now quietly watching, a gleaming collar of metal about her neck.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Most people in Dularn think the `same'," Carol smiled back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Wouldn't  have stood much of a chance against  `that',"  he 
        smiled, my brownette nodding, her hazel eyes meeting his in turn.  
        With her raincoat off the Warlady was impressive in her uniform.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Dularn has never sought war with the Empire," Carol spoke.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Darlanis has `dreams' of being the `second Janet  Rogers'," 
        he  admitted,  seeing my wife nod in reply as she sipped  at  her 
        wine.  Her hazel eyes over the rim of the goblet meeting his own.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Had  a `bad childhood' that she's still trying to  make  up 
        for," Carol smiled in reply.  "Tulis should have never `disowned' 
        her like she did though."  The thought going through Carol's mind 
        just then that as Tulis had "known" that Darlanis was not  really 
        her own daughter, perhaps the Queen had not looked upon her quite 
        the same as she would have had Darlanis been of her own "blood"!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There was a `rumor' I heard once that Darlanis wasn't actu-
        ally Tulis' daughter anyway, but some `bastard' that...," the ad-
        miral  answered, the rest of his words forgotten as a  midshipman 
        knocked and entered the cabin in reply to his command to "enter".
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The Diana is `signaling' us and has come about facing  us," 
        the midshipman spoke, eying Carol as if she was some "alien"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Send `thirty' in standard code, nothing else," Carol spoke.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Stand down from battle stations, and drop both forward  an-
        chors," I ordered, seeing the signals now from Sarnian Queen.   I 
        saw Sandra nod, an expression of relief going over her  features.  
        "Keep steam up on number two boiler, and warmth on the others," I 
        added, the "boom" of the thunder like distant guns in the cabin.  
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Looks  like our boat is putting off from Sarnian Queen,"  I 
        heard Sandra say, the captain suddenly jerking back as a thunder-
        ous  "BANG" seemed to hit the Diana, a strange  eerie  flickering 
        bright  light  for just an instant seeming  to  illuminate  every 
        thing  while I felt my hair stand on end and an electrical  shock 
        course through me!  It was obvious that the Diana had been struck 
        by  lightning!  Then I thought of the midshipman standing on  the 
        top of the quickfirer turret!  Had she been struck by the bolt?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Signal Carol to return to Sarnian Queen," I said to Sandra, 
        climbing  the ladder to the quickfirer turret.  "She can stay  on 
        aboard until the storm is over," Sandra doing so with the carbide 
        lamp commonly used for such purposes.  As it was now quite  dark, 
        I had no doubts that my wife would see the message I sent to her.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I  felt for a pulse in her throat as I pressed my lips  down 
        upon  the girl's, her wide open blue eyes staring sightlessly  up 
        into  the  rain, and feeling none, I tore open her  clothing  and 
        pushed hard down on her naked chest with the heel of my hand as I 
        started artificial respiration.  I felt "responsible" for her, as 
        I should have "withdrawn" her from her station when the lightning 
        started to get bad, the rain pouring down upon me unnoticed  just 
        then in my attempt to save her...  WHY GOD HAD I FORGOTTEN HER???
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Get the Physician!" I cried to Sandra as her head  appeared 
        in  the hatchway.  Turning back then to the luckless  girl  whose 
        life I had been so thoughtless to risk for no good reason at all!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "LYS, OR WHO EVER YOU ARE, SPARE HER LIFE FOR ME!" I  begged 
        in my thoughts, breathing for the girl, forcing her heart to beat 
        with  the heel of my hand against her bare chest just  under  her 
        young  still girlish bare left breast, the golden clip that  cov-
        ered  her nipple pressing up against the palm of my hand.  I  was 
        aware  that another lightning bolt could strike the Diana at  any 
        time, that we were the "highest point" on the ship in a sense...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Here," the Physician said, shoving a hypo into her  breast, 
        her  eyes meeting mine.  As long as we could force her  heart  to 
        beat, her lungs to provide oxygen to her blood, she would live...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I've `wasted' her life," I said, weeping now, the tears un-
        noticed, the girl's blonde hair dark in the rain.  I had "closed" 
        her eyes, aware that it was my own "fault" that she was dead now!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm  getting a pulse," the Physician answered, soaking  wet 
        like me now in the rain.  "Weak, but its there," she said to me.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Admiral," the girl breathed, her eyes looking up into mine.  
        I took her hand, held it.  Just then naval discipline meant noth-
        ing to me.  Susanna Anders giving me a smile, telling me that she 
        needed her rest.  "There was this great big flash of light, and I 
        saw  myself lying there on the deck, the entire Diana  below  me.  
        Then  you came and `worked' on me, and I saw this very  beautiful 
        woman come and say to me that I had to go `back', that I couldn't 
        `stay' with her even though I so wanted to, she was so beautiful, 
        so nice that I didn't want to ever go back to `here' again..."  I 
        nodded, well aware of the description, of its "meanings" here...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I asked Lys for your life, and She gave it to me," I said.
