<a id="p75" name="p75"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(75)" >Pitchblende, Lucifer's executive secretary, placed the most recent marketing reports on the Archfiend's glossy lacquered red desk.</p>
<a id="p76" name="p76"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(76)" >Lucifer glanced through the hefty sheaf of papers&#151;Vice, Usury, War, Disease, Famine, Telephone Solicitation . . . all the big evils were there.</p>
<a id="p77" name="p77"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(77)" >The <i>Lust and Fornication American Quarterly</i> report showed good movement in the Lust Department. Mini-skirts and see-through blouses were back in, sexual harassment suits were on the rise, and Agonostis had opened some very clever new markets by taking advantage of cutting-edge technology&#151;pornographic CD-ROMs, computer sex-games, and online sex services were skyrocketing. Agonostis' R&amp;D people were doing wonders with virtual reality technology, too, and expected to have their full-sensory-stimulus products on the market even before any practical VR applications became available.</p>
<a id="p78" name="p78"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(78)" >Lucifer frowned when he saw the Fornication numbers, though. Fornication had been <i>the</i> blue-chip market since time began&#151;an absolute sure thing guaranteed to produce steadily increasing revenues no matter what else was going on in the world. As long as there were more people (and there were always more people) fornication kept right on increasing. Yet Agonostis' numbers were down&#151;markedly down. If Lucifer remembered correctly, they had trended downward in the past two quarters as well.</p>
<a id="p79" name="p79"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(79)" >The Archfiend tapped a few keys on his keyboard to bring up Quick'N'Dead, Hell's soul-accounting program, then ran through the graphs for Fornication for the last year, then the last three years, and finally the last five. He grew angrier with every new set of graphs. He should have checked this earlier&#151;Agonostis had managed to counterbalance his Fornication numbers with his Lust numbers so that his reports still showed a net damnedsoul increase, but Lucifer discovered Fornication had been dropping off in fits and starts for five straight years. A five-year drop in a blue-chip asset could only come from poor management.</p>
<a id="p80" name="p80"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(80)" >It was about time to remind Agonostis that not all jobs in Hell were desk jobs.</p>
<a id="p81" name="p81"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(81)" >Lucifer nibbled on one long, pointed talon and contemplated risky, difficult field assignments.</p>
<a id="p82" name="p82"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(82)" >Agonostis needed one.</p>
