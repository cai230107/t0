<h2 class="chapter">21</h2>

<p>Once again I fluttered around Mogaba&rsquo;s head. Me, Murgen,
angel of espionage.</p>

<p>Howler and Longshadow had arrived soon after dawn. They believed
it would take both their concerted efforts to keep Lady from
ripping Mogaba a new poop chute. Lady&rsquo;s powers seemed to
swell as she moved farther south.</p>

<p>An idea hit like religious epiphany. I knew the fear that
haunted the Captain. He suspected that Lady had regained her powers
by making a pact with Kina.</p>

<p>I have suspected that myself, off and on.</p>

<p>The way sorcery works, the way I understood it, her loss of
powers during the battle at the Barrowland should have been
irreversible. It had to do with some unfathomable mystical
gobbledegook about true names. Gunni mythology contained numerous
stories about how gods and demons and devils went around hiding
their true names in rocks or trees or grains of sand on the beach
so their enemies would not be able to glom onto them and gain a
hold. The whole business made no sense but that did not keep it
from working.</p>

<p>Lady&rsquo;s true name had been named during the final showdown
with her husband. She survived but, according to the mystical
rules, was now an ordinary mortal. With looks to kill for. What
made her interesting to people in her former trade was that she was
a living storehouse of wicked lore. She had not lost any of her
knowledge, only the ability to employ it.</p>

<p>I was surprised that she had not been a bigger target than she
had so far.</p>

<p>Her name had no power over her anymore. Being powerless herself,
apparently, she could not take advantage of those true names she
knew. Otherwise she would have dealt with the Howler and her sister
a long time ago. And she would not give those names away even to
One-Eye and Goblin. She would die first.</p>

<p>It takes a strange sort to become a wizard or sorceress.</p>

<p>She had her own agenda still, that was certain. One-Eye or
Goblin were not much but some things were like dropping a rock down
a well.</p>

<p>From conversations overheard I knew Longshadow would part with
three or four thumbs to get hold of what Lady knew.</p>

<p>Funny. Whenever he sent Howler to capture her the scheme machine
never quite clicked. You would almost think Howler did not want his
senior partner to become any more senior.</p>

<p>Someday I will have to get Lady to explain the whole true names
thing in a way that even a dummy like me can understand. Maybe I
can get her to explain the whole business of sorcery so that those
of us who study these Annals will have at least a vague idea of
what is going on.</p>

<p>Knowing will not keep us from crapping our small clothes when we
run into sorcery but, still, it would be nice to have a notion what
is behind all the deadly lights.</p>

<p>The Shadowlander soldiers were all in place. They gnawed field
rations sleepily, hard at work at what soldiers do most. While we
all waited I hung around those who spoke languages I could
understand. The philosophers among them examined the intellects and
characters of generals who put their troops into formation and made
them stand ready when nothing was going to happen. Nothing. The
damned Tals were too damned tired to do anything. They had spent
the whole damned night on the move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tal&rdquo; was a sort of pun. Though short for
&ldquo;Taglian&rdquo; it also meant &ldquo;turd&rdquo; in the
Sangel dialects common south of the Dandha Presh.</p>

<p>I felt like I had soldiered with those guys. They spoke my
language.</p>

<p>Mogaba had built himself a giant observation tower a safe
distance behind the lines. It was wooden. I thought he was going to
find it uncomfortable pretty soon. Longshadow and Howler had joined
him up there. The atmosphere was not festive but it was far from
grim. Nobody was worried about us.</p>

<p>Longshadow threatened to become cheerful. This battle was the
culmination of all his planning. When it was over nothing could
stop him from making himself master of the world. Except maybe a
few allies who did not quite share his ambitions.</p>

<p>I was hurt. A guy likes to be taken seriously. Mogaba had these
people, from top to bottom, believing they were invincible.</p>

<p>In the soldiering business you are often what you think you
are.</p>

<p>Confidence generates victory.</p>

<p>Howler did not scream once while I watched. Longshadow did not
throw one tantrum.</p>

<p>Much as they fussed about Lady you would think they would be
more tense.</p>
