<h2 class="chapter">86</h2>

<p>Things went too well for too long. Summer was an idyll. It never
got too hot. The rains were perfect for the crops we planted. We
were threatened with the sort of harvest for which peasants pray.
We made sure the peasants we encountered understood that the
wonderful weather was all our fault. Our foragers had liberated
draft animals enough to support us if we traveled light, leaving
the heavy equipment that had followed us down from friendly
territory. There were even a few sheep for those not bound by Gunni
strictures against eating flesh.</p>

<p>The old saw is true. An army does travel on its stomach. What we
accomplished by projecting the Taglian will the distance we did was
a tribute to Croaker&rsquo;s planning, preparation and devotion.
And psychosis. And, of course, it was founded on the four years
given us by Longshadow&rsquo;s utter failure to interfere. Poor
boy. Should have listened to Mogaba. He would not be living in a
kennel. Not that he could be faulted for having been deceived by
the Mother of Deceivers when Kina could spin webs of deception to
warp the eyesight of gods as great as she.</p>

<p>We had not yet fattened up from the winter but we were getting
set to take the next leap already.</p>

<p>Neither Soulcatcher nor Mogaba, neither lost Taglian loyalists
nor the local population seemed further inclined to make our lives
miserable. We were getting along with the latter fairly well,
now.</p>

<p>After apparently at Lady&rsquo;s insistence finally sending
recon forces to winkle out the secrets of Overlook, the Old Man had
discovered that the fortress contained several treasures. Half
became the Company treasury, something we have not had for a
generation. All pledged brothers received equal shares of the rest.
Eventually, Croaker ordered a market established where locals could
bring anything they cared to sell.</p>

<p>Results were disappointing at first. But once we demonstrated
that we would not rob or murder anybody trade picked up. Peasants
are resilient. They are realists. These did not see how our yoke
could weigh heavier than Longshadow&rsquo;s. They had no problems
with old or imagined myths of the Black Company despite existing so
much closer to Khatovar.</p>

<p>They did not know the name Khatovar, as such, either. Nor were
they concerned about Kina, under any of her names. Their Kina was a
creator as well as a destroyer, fierce but no unhallowed queen of
darkness. The Year of the Skulls was no terror to them. They could
imagine no future more grim than their past.</p>

<p>Nobody hailed us as liberators, however. We were but the shadow
that displaced the darkness.</p>

<p>I wandered the market occasionally, accompanied by Thai Dei and
an interpreter. Thai Dei objected. He was sure my curiosity would
get me killed. He was not shy about advising me that curiosity was
a lethal curse.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj usually tagged along. Despite pretenses to the
contrary, a lot of strain had developed between us. I could not
forgive Sarie&rsquo;s absence, though I controlled my urge to bring
my knowledge into the open. What I did to irritate him was ask
every southerner I interviewed about the constellation called the
Noose.</p>

<p>But nobody knew it.</p>

<p>Except for the devastation that was Kiaulune it would have
seemed a good world.</p>

<p>I enjoyed myself, except for missing Sarie. And I saw her in my
dreams. There were fewer demands on me lately, though I was in
charge at the Shadowgate. Red Rudy and Bucket did most of the real
work there, showing me the ropes as they went. Nobody said so but I
was getting educated in case I ever had to take over. I did not
remind anybody that I managed the Old Crew tolerably during our
ordeal in Dejagore. I did not remind them that we had a Lieutenant
and she was a whole lot more experienced and hard-edged than me.
Anytime you say anything you just get more work piled on.</p>
