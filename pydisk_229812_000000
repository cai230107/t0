<a id="p1739" name="p1739"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1739)" > "Mistress Irene! Mistress Irene!" Andromeda charged into the stableyard, droplets of fresh blood spattering from the flapping skirts of her mail tunic. The Persian ambassador's entourage scattered like chickens as she plunged through them, waving her arms. "The Empress just bit the head off a live goat!"</p>
<a id="p1740" name="p1740"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1740)" >Irene waved back, then noticed that the Persian ambassador had quietly fainted into the clean straw on the stable floor. She sighed and handed the halter rope of the ambassador's Berber mare to the Hippolyta. "Please revive the ambassador," Irene said, "and explain to him that the Empress, in this instance, is a griffin." The real Empress, Irene thought as she hurried to meet her apprentice, would never bite the head off a goat&#151;not when she had ambassadors and imperial officers available.</p>
<a id="p1741" name="p1741"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1741)" >Irene reached and passed her blood-splashed apprentice without stopping, heading for the griffin's aerie. Andi managed a skidding about-face, adding a patina of dust to her bloody armor, and scrambled to reach Irene's side. Andi's legs were twice as long as Irene's&#151;but it was almost always Andi trotting to keep up. "Sorry about the ambassador, Mistress."</p>
<a id="p1742" name="p1742"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1742)" >"He'll be fine," Irene said dismissively. "He's new. You might want to <i>try</i> to remember to call the Golden Empress `Goldie,' though, just to avoid this sort of confusion."</p>
<a id="p1743" name="p1743"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1743)" >Andi colored. "Should I go back and apologize?"</p>
<a id="p1744" name="p1744"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1744)" >"Certainly not! We've a superfluity of Persian ambassadors, but only one griffin."</p>
<a id="p1745" name="p1745"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1745)" >Irene's pace carried them quickly through the small garden that buffered the Aerie and disguised the feeding pens. Irene shouldered through the antechamber door, Andi on her heels.</p>
<a id="p1746" name="p1746"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1746)" >A half dozen goats cowered in the near corner of the aerie, too terrified even to bleat. Irene didn't blame them. Goldie's tawny feathers were crimson with blood. She gripped the corpse with one forefoot, probing the torn belly with her hooked beak.</p>
<a id="p1747" name="p1747"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1747)" >"I brought her several goats to choose from," Andi whispered, bending so that she was closer to Irene's ear, "but she grabbed the Judas, the female in estrus I used to make the males more biddable."</p>
<a id="p1748" name="p1748"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1748)" >Suddenly the griffin stilled. She made a soft croaking sound, then lifted her head, a mass of pink flesh in her beak. As Andi and Irene watched anxiously, she choked down the organs, her twitching wings stretched to their full sixteen-foot span.</p>
<a id="p1749" name="p1749"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1749)" >"What's that she's eating?" Andi whispered.</p>
<a id="p1750" name="p1750"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1750)" >Irene squinted and whispered back. "Ovaries. And a uterus, I think." Irene thumped a fist against her thigh. "The Fading <i>is</i> connected to a breeding cycle. Her humors are unbalanced!"</p>
<a id="p1751" name="p1751"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1751)" >Goldie stood for a moment, eyes closed, making the same soft croaking. Her wings slowed and mantled, and she looked down at the dead beast beneath her talons as though surprised to see it there. After a moment, she settled to her haunches and began to feed normally.</p>
<a id="p1752" name="p1752"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1752)" >"Good girl, oh, good, my beauty," Irene murmured. Tears slid silently down her face. Six months ago, Goldie's amber plumage had been sleek and glossy, her eyes bright with intelligence and curiosity. Now she was thin beneath her dull and brittle feathers, her dark eyes haunted. Irene leaned against the aerie's arabesque of iron bars, watching the Golden Empress feed.</p>
<a id="p1753" name="p1753"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1753)" >Irene felt Andi's hand squeeze her shoulder. "She took milk this morning too, Mistress," Andi said, "Warm from the cow, just as Master Kerides suggested."</p>
<a id="p1754" name="p1754"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1754)" >"Wonderful," Irene said. She straightened, wiping her damp face on the purple breast scarf that marked her as one of the Empress Theodora's officers. Andi plucked the scarf out of her hand and substituted a handkerchief.</p>
<a id="p1755" name="p1755"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1755)" >Irene blew her nose. "As long as she's eating there's hope. Kerides has kept Windwing alive for a full year since her Fading began." She fisted her hands against the bars of the aerie. "Goldie <i>has</i> to live long enough for you to complete your apprenticeship, so that you, not Tulius, take my place."</p>
<a id="p1756" name="p1756"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1756)" >Andi's face twisted. "Theodora has known you all your life. I can't believe she'd have you killed."</p>
<a id="p1757" name="p1757"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1757)" >Irene turned resigned eyes to her apprentice. "The Golden Empress is Princess Helena's signet beast, the augury of her future reign. In my arrogant youth, I swore I'd keep the griffin alive. If Goldie dies, I won't live to see the next dawn."</p>
<a id="p1758" name="p1758"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1758)" >"We'll heal Goldie," Andi said. "You won't die."</p>
<a id="p1759" name="p1759"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1759)" >Irene stared at the feeding griffin. "Well, not today, anyway." Her hands relaxed. "Rescue the leftovers, will you? Then get changed. We have to go to the menagerie."</p>
<a id="p1760" name="p1760"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1760)" >Andi paled. "For how long?"</p>
<a id="p1761" name="p1761"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1761)" >Irene rubbed at her eyes. "That depends on how many animals from yesterday's `performance' are still alive."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1762" name="p1762"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1762)" >A long stone ramp led to the catacomb of cells and cages that ran beneath the hippodrome. The walls distorted the cries of the captive animals, so that the stones themselves seemed to wail, and in that stygian closeness the smell of blood and sweat and rotting waste was almost stifling.</p>
<a id="p1763" name="p1763"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1763)" >"Honoring us with a visit, Irene?"</p>
<a id="p1764" name="p1764"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1764)" >Irene turned. "Good-day, Tulius."</p>
<a id="p1765" name="p1765"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1765)" >Tulius was tall and darkly handsome, and Irene had seen him be charming when he had something to gain by it. It made his easy cruelty all the more grotesque. Irene nodded toward the first corridor of cages. "We'll see the animals now, thank you."</p>
<a id="p1766" name="p1766"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1766)" >Tulius made an ironic bow. "Certainly. We lost half the hyenas, and two of the lions, but there're others that may do for the arena again if you want to patch them up."</p>
<a id="p1767" name="p1767"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1767)" >"Which lions?" Andi demanded. "You didn't fight Leda? What did you do with her cubs?"</p>
<a id="p1768" name="p1768"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1768)" >"Did you miss the show? Too bad! I loosed the hyenas on the cubs, then set the lions on the hyenas. It was inspired."</p>
<a id="p1769" name="p1769"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1769)" >Andi's eyes blazed. Irene set a hand on her shoulder. "Which lions did you lose?"</p>
<a id="p1770" name="p1770"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1770)" >"The big male&#151;a shame about that&#151;and the mother. The hyenas got one cub, but the two surviving lionesses drove off what was left of the pack before they got the other." He made a face, mockingly tragic. "Of course, I had to have it destroyed anyway. Too young to live without its mother. Well, enjoy your rounds, ladies. I'm sure you can find your own way." He threw a ring of keys at Irene. Managing not to flinch, she snatched them out of the air before they struck her in the face.</p>
<a id="p1771" name="p1771"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1771)" >This was the man who wanted her place, wanted control of her animals, of her people, of <i>Andi</i>. If my Golden Empress dies, Irene thought, before the princess's Varangians come for me, perhaps I will come for you.</p>
<a id="p1772" name="p1772"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1772)" >Tulius turned on his heel and went whistling up the corridor toward the arena. Andi stared after him, her eyes speaking hate. Irene touched her arm. "Andi. There's nothing you can do for the dead ones. Let's go see what we can do for the living."</p>
<a id="p1773" name="p1773"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1773)" >"They're all dead," Andi said bitterly. "Just some of them are still breathing."</p>
<a id="p1774" name="p1774"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1774)" >Irene gave a small crooked smile. "You could say the same of me. Or of anyone." Irene took Andi's hand, squeezed it. "We all cheat death one breath at a time."</p>
<a id="p1775" name="p1775"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1775)" >Andi squared her shoulders. "Let's go cheat like hell."</p>
<a id="p1776" name="p1776"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1776)" >A weak or sickly beast did not make a good show, so Tulius's captives at least had clean water and adequate food. But their quarters were cramped, and they lived in a miasma of fear and filth where even a minor wound could turn deadly.</p>
<a id="p1777" name="p1777"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1777)" >One of the surviving lionesses had a shallow gash in her flank, which only needed to be cleansed and stitched.</p>
<a id="p1778" name="p1778"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1778)" >The second lioness was not so simple. Though the bone of her injured leg was miraculously unbroken, the flesh was deeply torn, in places hanging in strips like meat cut for smoking. Serious infection had already set in, angry-looking purple streaks running into the undamaged flesh of hock and thigh.</p>
<a id="p1779" name="p1779"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1779)" >Irene shook her head. "The poison's entering her blood. It might be kindest just to cut her throat."</p>
<a id="p1780" name="p1780"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1780)" >"No!" Andi protested. Irene looked at her sharply and the younger woman reddened. "We can give her a chance."</p>
<a id="p1781" name="p1781"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1781)" >Irene squatted back on her haunches. "Talk."</p>
<a id="p1782" name="p1782"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1782)" >"I have a new medicine," Andi said, "supposed to fight this kind of infection. The Varangian who told me of it swore by it."</p>
<a id="p1783" name="p1783"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1783)" >"Varangians swear by a lot of things," Irene said doubtfully. "False gods. Their swords. Beer." She nodded. "Try it."</p>
<a id="p1784" name="p1784"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1784)" >Andi flashed a smile, put flame to her blade and began to excise the wound. She scraped some of the deadly ooze into one of Irene's costly glass jars.</p>
<a id="p1785" name="p1785"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1785)" >"What will you do with that?" Irene asked.</p>
<a id="p1786" name="p1786"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1786)" >"If I can get the poison to grow outside the flesh, perhaps in a dish of fresh blood, then I could try our medicines in turn, to see which best destroys it."</p>
<a id="p1787" name="p1787"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1787)" >Irene nodded approval, watchful as Andi packed the wound with a grey paste. "What's in your Varangian's goo?"</p>
<a id="p1788" name="p1788"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1788)" >Andi colored, but began to pull the tattered flesh together with small neat stitches. "Biscuit mold and spider webs."</p>
<a id="p1789" name="p1789"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1789)" >Irene smiled wearily. "Well, I've heard worse."</p>
<a id="p1790" name="p1790"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1790)" >By the time they finished their rounds in the maze of cells, they were sick-hearted and weary. Irene sank to the thin straw that littered the passage, her back against the wall. Her head ached from working by lamp and torchlight, her fingers were cramped from wielding knife and needle and her hands raw from repeated washing. She closed her burning eyes for a moment, feeling vaguely guilty as Andi cleansed their instruments and emptied basins into the narrow gutters.</p>
<a id="p1791" name="p1791"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1791)" >"Mistress?" Andi said. "What's this end cell for?"</p>
<a id="p1792" name="p1792"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1792)" >"It's called the Dragon Cage," Irene answered, without opening her eyes. "Large exotics were confined there, back when rare beasts like dragons were actually exhibited and killed in the arena. It hasn't been used for years."</p>
<a id="p1793" name="p1793"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1793)" >"It's in use now," Andi said grimly. Irene's eyes popped open and she sat up. Andi had her ear pressed shamelessly against the rough cedar door. "This lock is new, and I can hear something moving inside."</p>
<a id="p1794" name="p1794"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1794)" >"That bastard!" Irene spat, anger and alarm banishing fatigue. She scrambled up, fumbling for the ring of keys. The lock answered to none of them.</p>
<a id="p1795" name="p1795"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1795)" >Irene withdrew in frustration. "Damn. We can't get in."</p>
<a id="p1796" name="p1796"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1796)" >Andi bent and rummaged in the satchel, emerging with a farrier's hammer and horseshoe pry. "Bugger that," she said flatly. She planted the wedge of the pry against the lip of the door hasp and struck down hard with the farrier's hammer, once, twice. The hasp plate tore away from the wood and the whole lock assembly swung free.</p>
<a id="p1797" name="p1797"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1797)" >Both women pushed through the doorway into a small antechamber. Irene lifted the lantern to illuminate the barred cell beyond.</p>
<a id="p1798" name="p1798"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1798)" >Andi gasped. "Mistress Irene. <i>What is it</i>?"</p>
<a id="p1799" name="p1799"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1799)" >"I have no idea," Irene said softly.</p>
<a id="p1800" name="p1800"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1800)" >The creature was a lithe darkness against the grey stone, eyes shining an eerie green in the light. It was built like a lion the size of a <i>Kilbanophoros</i> steed, with a sleek scaled head atop a powerful, graceful neck that reminded Irene of horses. Then it arched its back like an enormous cat, and a series of bladelike scales rose like a clattering phalanx of spears along its spine. Lamplight spilled over scales and claws scratched on stone as the creature wheeled to face them head-on. It tried to shriek, but only a faint and angry hissing escaped its beaked and muzzled jaws.</p>
<a id="p1801" name="p1801"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1801)" >"I see you found my prize," Tulius said from behind them.</p>
<a id="p1802" name="p1802"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1802)" >"And I so wanted to surprise you."</p>
<a id="p1803" name="p1803"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1803)" >Irene turned furiously. "This is an exotic, Tulius! It belongs in the Imperial Mews, not in the arena!"</p>
<a id="p1804" name="p1804"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1804)" >"Oh, yes?" Tulius's posture was confident, his eyes and voice amused. "Now, <i>Mistress</i>, I have a long, long list, written in your own hand, of creatures you may take from me in the Empress's name." His voice went low with sudden hatred. "I know that list as well as you, you dwarfish bitch, and that creature <i>is not on it</i>. Therefore, it is <i>mine.</i>"</p>
<a id="p1805" name="p1805"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1805)" >The Black Beast lunged at Tulius, crashing against the bars of the cage. Talons snagged on iron and scraped parallel grooves in the stone floor.</p>
<a id="p1806" name="p1806"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1806)" >Tulius laughed, an honestly joyous, happy sound. "A prince of the Vandals comes to the City, and I promised the Empress a fitting entertainment for her barbarian guest. My Black Beast will kill until the sands are red, and he will die magnificently." He grinned and leaned over Irene's small frame, his predator breath hot in her face. "I and my Black Beast will be remembered when you are a long-forgotten joke, <i>Mistress</i> Irene."</p>
<a id="p1807" name="p1807"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1807)" >"The Empress takes no pleasure in such things!"</p>
<a id="p1808" name="p1808"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1808)" >"But the prince <i>does</i>," Tulius said with confidence. "And your precious Empress values a treaty with his father more than the life of this beast."</p>
<a id="p1809" name="p1809"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1809)" >"Left to your care, the beast might not live to see the arena," Andi said. Irene and Tulius turned. Andi knelt beside the bars of the cage, the beast scant inches away on the other side of the bars. Its chest scales rattled as it struggled for breath. "At least take the muzzle off it. It's overheated. It needs to pant, like a dog or a lion. It also has untreated wounds." Andi addressed Irene. "It must have been caught with wire snares. There are lacerations, one high on the right hind leg, another just above the wrist joint of the left fore. They're underneath the lap of the scales, so I only saw them when the beast leaped at the bars."</p>
<a id="p1810" name="p1810"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1810)" >"Any sick animal is under my jurisdiction," Irene reminded Tulius sharply.</p>
<a id="p1811" name="p1811"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1811)" >Tulius laughed. "The Black Beast isn't sick. You want to take its muzzle off, they're your hands." With easy arrogance he took a key from a cord around his neck and handed it to Andi. "Bandage him up while you're at it, if it will make you happy. But the Empress knows about the beast&#151;and she has said I may use it in the arena."</p>
<a id="p1812" name="p1812"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1812)" >"I can't believe that," Irene said, stricken. "I'll go to Theodora myself. She won't&#151;she can't&#151;let something so rare and beautiful be destroyed."</p>
<a id="p1813" name="p1813"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1813)" >Tulius grinned. "Ask her." He tossed Irene a salute and sauntered out of the chamber.</p>
<a id="p1814" name="p1814"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1814)" >The Black Beast raised its head to watch him go, rumbling with impotent hate.</p>
<a id="p1815" name="p1815"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1815)" >Andi fetched their satchel. She took something from it, then slowly knelt before the bars again, her eyes locked with the beast's baleful glare. Slowly, the muted growl died. From amidst the scales, graceful ears lifted. Andi held her right hand motionless, cupped just before her chin.</p>
<a id="p1816" name="p1816"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1816)" >"Shhhh," she whispered. The creature arched its graceful neck toward her. At the base of the muzzled beak, nostrils flared wide to take in her scent.</p>
<a id="p1817" name="p1817"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1817)" >Andi's lips puffed. The soporific powder smoked through the bars, drawn deep into the beast's throat and lungs.</p>
<a id="p1818" name="p1818"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1818)" >The long neck swayed as the beast drew back; the heavy, beaked head sank down onto the armored breast. In a little bit, it slumped onto its side, unconscious.</p>
<a id="p1819" name="p1819"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1819)" >Irene set her hand on Andi's shoulder. "Well done."</p>
<a id="p1820" name="p1820"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1820)" >Andi turned her eyes to Irene's, and Irene saw in them a reflection of her own despair. She turned her eyes away, and, taking the key, opened the door of the cage.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1821" name="p1821"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1821)" >Irene hoped she'd be allowed to see the Empress before she'd sweat-soaked all three layers of her court clothes. Her costly cotton tunica was more forgiving than silk, but the wide-sleeved underdress was amber-colored samite, her overdress russet silk trimmed in shades of yellow and amber. Her cap and superhumeral, the wide formal collar, matched the underdress and were trimmed in seed pearls and amber drops.</p>
<a id="p1822" name="p1822"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1822)" >She felt like a courtesan's bed-curtain.</p>
<a id="p1823" name="p1823"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1823)" >One of Theodora's secretaries, a small, slim eunuch named, inappropriately, Herakles, came out of the Blue Chamber. "The Empress will see you now, Mistress Irene," he said, "but be quick. She's tired, and she has much more to do before she will consent to rest."</p>
<a id="p1824" name="p1824"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1824)" >Irene nodded. Wishing she could calm her fluttering stomach, she drew a deep breath and followed Herakles into the Blue Chamber.</p>
<a id="p1825" name="p1825"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1825)" >The Empress Theodora VI was seated in a highbacked chair behind an elegantly simple wooden table. On a stool beside her mother sat the seventeen-year-old Princess Helena, frowning over a wax tablet as she nibbled an apple slice. A platter of cold chicken and fruit and a water jug were wedged in between piles of documents. A half-dozen secretaries worked at low desks or glided to and from the table and racks that held maps, books, and parchments. A high window admitted air without making enough of a breeze to trouble the papers.</p>
<a id="p1826" name="p1826"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1826)" >Irene prostrated herself, awkward in her unaccustomed clothes, then moved forward to kneel on one of the cushions scattered before the table, to wait for the Empress to acknowledge her.</p>
<a id="p1827" name="p1827"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1827)" >Helena noticed her first. "Mistress Irene! I'm sorry I've been too busy here to come to the aerie. How is my Goldie?"</p>
<a id="p1828" name="p1828"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1828)" >Irene felt relief that she could honestly give a good report. "She is better, Highness. She fed well yesterday."</p>
<a id="p1829" name="p1829"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1829)" >The Empress put her signature to the paper before her and handed it off to a secretary. Helena hastened to move the platter of food beneath her mother's fingers before she could select another document. Theodora spared a smile for her daughter, and took a piece of food without looking. "Mistress Irene," Theodora acknowledged. She inclined her head. "You may sit." She ate a bite of chicken while Irene settled more comfortably. "I assume you are here about Tulius's Black Beast."</p>
<a id="p1830" name="p1830"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1830)" >Irene's heart sank. "Yes, my Empress. Tulius means to have it torn apart in the arena." She looked up at the woman she had served all her adult life and found herself pleading. "My lady, please&#151;it is unique, perhaps the only one of its kind. It is&#151;it is beautiful, perhaps intelligent as well. You can't allow it to simply be destroyed."</p>
<a id="p1831" name="p1831"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1831)" >"One does not say `can't' to one's Empress, Irene," Theodora said sharply. Irene quailed, and the Empress went on more gently. "I understand. You are as passionate in your calling as I am in mine. But my concerns are larger than yours. I have intelligence that this Vandal princeling has a barbarian's taste for a bloody show, and I have need to please him." She made a face. "As little as I like it, his people control trade routes that we need. I learn from my ancestress: treaties are better than war. I'm sorry, but unless circumstances change, the beast belongs to Tulius." The Empress took another document and turned her eyes to it. "You may go."</p>
<a id="p1832" name="p1832"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1832)" >Irene made obeisance and got slowly to her feet. As she turned to go, the Empress's voice caught her. "Oh, and Mistress Irene, a word of advice." Irene froze. "If I were you, I would concentrate my attention on the creatures already in your care."</p>
<a id="p1833" name="p1833"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1833)" >The Empress's pen dipped, tapped, and began to write. Irene was dismissed.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1834" name="p1834"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1834)" >"She said, `Unless circumstances change, the beast belongs to Tulius.' I'm so sorry, Andi."</p>
<a id="p1835" name="p1835"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1835)" >Andi knelt beside Irene's bed and carefully folded Irene's cold fingers around a cup of mulled wine. "It's not your fault, Mistress." The younger woman stayed kneeling by the bed, one hard, thin arm curved loosely around Irene's waist.</p>
<a id="p1836" name="p1836"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1836)" >Irene forced herself to drink the hot sweet wine, feeling its heat begin to melt her cramped muscles. "I feel my life's work slipping away from me," she said. "I thought I'd made a sanctuary, a place where animals could be cared for and studied. Now a fabulous, unknown beast is going to be torn to pieces <i>to please a Vandal!</i>" She lifted a hand to her eyes. "If Tulius gets the Mews, it will be as if I'd never lived."</p>
<a id="p1837" name="p1837"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1837)" >"Don't say that!" Andi snapped. "Even if the worst happens, if Goldie dies and some Varangian knifes you in your bed and Tulius takes over here, you've <i>still</i> saved scores of animals from the arena, advanced our knowledge tenfold! And you've taught me, much more than healing. I swear to you, Irene&#151;Tulius isn't going to win." For the first time, Andi put her arms around Irene and hugged her.</p>
<a id="p1838" name="p1838"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1838)" >Irene hugged back, drawing a fierce comfort from the press of Andi's body, warm and hard even through the quilted tunic. "Thank you," she whispered.</p>
<a id="p1839" name="p1839"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1839)" >Andi drew back, gestured at the cup. "I'll make you more wine. I'll go to the menagerie, check on the animals and change the bandages, while you stay here and rest."</p>
<a id="p1840" name="p1840"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1840)" >"No," Irene shook her head. "No, Tulius may have won this battle&#151;but I'm damned if I'll let him see me surrender the war." She straightened her shoulders, wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, and sniffed. She grinned a little. "You're fragrant. What were you doing while I groveled?"</p>
<a id="p1841" name="p1841"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1841)" >"Oiling Goldie. For bug repellent, this stuff isn't too bad. You aren't going to make me change, are you?"</p>
<a id="p1842" name="p1842"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1842)" >"No. I rather like rosemary and cedar with base notes of griffin." Irene rose and went to ready their horses while Andi checked their supplies.</p>
<a id="p1843" name="p1843"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1843)" >To Irene's relief, Tulius was about other business, and they were able to make their rounds without disturbance. The lioness with the shallow wound was moving easily, and willingly accepted a treat of drugged meat. Andi's special patient, recipient of the "Varangian goo," was awake and alert, though she had yet to take solid food. Sedating her, they found her wound much better, the swelling and fever reduced. Encouraged by the success, they went to see the Black Beast.</p>
<a id="p1844" name="p1844"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1844)" >The antechamber door was open, the key to the Black Beast's cell hanging from the inside handle of the door. Irene felt a twinge of anger, knowing this easy access was Tulius's taunt, daring her to defy Theodora.</p>
<a id="p1845" name="p1845"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1845)" >The Black Beast lifted its head at their entrance, making a soft, curious honk. It rose to its feet and came to the bars, surveying them with large dark eyes. "It's much calmer today," Irene said.</p>
<a id="p1846" name="p1846"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1846)" >"Tulius isn't here," Andi said. "It remembers us." She knelt by the bars, crooning. "Don't you remember me, Beastie?"</p>
<a id="p1847" name="p1847"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1847)" >The Black Beast took a step backward, yanking back its head and squeezing its nostrils shut. Irene laughed. "It remembers you all right." Realization touched her, leaving grief where wonder should have been. "Andi, it's intelligent. On some level, it understands what's happening to it." She reached out, gently touching the bars of the cage. "Oh, Beastie, I'm sorry."</p>
<a id="p1848" name="p1848"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1848)" >The Black Beast looked at Irene, then at Andi. Andi held her hands up, flat, to show that they were empty. The beast came closer, almost mincing, and flared its nostrils wide. It snuffled all around Andi through the bars, even extending a leathery grey tongue to taste her hands. It made a soft croaking noise and <i>puffed</i>, all its scales standing out from its body so that it looked like a quadruped pinecone. Irene, standing to one side, noticed something else. "Andi, you have an admirer."</p>
<a id="p1849" name="p1849"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1849)" >Andi leaned over and peeked between the Black Beast's legs, then shook her head at the beast. "Trust me, boy, I'm not your type." She did take advantage of the beast's interest by giving him a drugged treat.</p>
<a id="p1850" name="p1850"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1850)" >The beast gave her an accusing look just before his double eyelids slowly shuttered closed. "I'll change his bandages," Andi offered. Irene just nodded, deep in thought. There was something about the Black Beast, about the way it had responded to Andi, that was teasing at her mind, something terribly important, but the harder she tried to grasp it, the more elusive it became. Andi had to tap her on the shoulder to tell her it was time to leave.</p>
<a id="p1851" name="p1851"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1851)" >Outside the torchlit gloom of the menagerie, a purple dusk was falling, nightjars stitching the sky with their cries. All the way home, Irene's thoughts went in circles like puppies chasing their tails.</p>
<a id="p1852" name="p1852"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1852)" >They were on their way back to their quarters from the stable when the dovecote boy caught up to them, his face pale by the light of his lantern. "Mistress Irene. A pigeon came while you were gone. One of the big red ones."</p>
<a id="p1853" name="p1853"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1853)" >"One of Kerides'," Irene said, hope in her voice. "Do you have the message capsule, Thomas?"</p>
<a id="p1854" name="p1854"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1854)" >The boy looked down. "I'm sorry, Mistress." He reached out and pressed something into Irene's hand. "This is all there was."</p>
<a id="p1855" name="p1855"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1855)" >The bit of black ribbon lay in Irene's palm like a snippet of night. "Windwing and Kerides are dead," Irene said, and turned her face to the darkness.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1856" name="p1856"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1856)" >She clawed her way out of sleep, pushing and hitting at the hands that gripped her shoulders. The hands retreated and Irene sat up, aching and sick and dizzy, a flood of lantern light blinding her eyes. She threw her arm up to shield her face.</p>
<a id="p1857" name="p1857"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1857)" >"Get that damned light off me," she snapped. The light withdrew. Irene squinted, saw the creased face of Anna, one of the gate guards, looking anxiously down at her.</p>
<a id="p1858" name="p1858"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1858)" >"Mistress Irene, I'm sorry," the woman said. "Your quarters were empty, and the Master of the Menagerie has sent for you in all urgency." She frowned. "He said you would know why."</p>
<a id="p1859" name="p1859"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1859)" >Irene staggered to her feet. She was in the antechamber of Goldie's aerie, one of Goldie's winter blankets and an empty wine jug tumbled at her feet. Memory came flooding back, and with it a heartache far worse than the ache in her head and body. Windwing and Kerides were dead. She looked over at the hulk of her griffin, was surprised to see her awake, the great eyes reflecting green in the faint rays of lantern light.</p>
<a id="p1860" name="p1860"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1860)" >"You did well to find me at all, Anna," Irene told the guard, grateful she hadn't gotten drunk enough to try to sleep with Goldie.</p>
<a id="p1861" name="p1861"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1861)" >Irene went to the water cistern and dunked her head. The cold water revived her. "I have a guess what Tulius wants," she said, mopping her face with the tail of her purple scarf. "Andi wasn't in our quarters?"</p>
<a id="p1862" name="p1862"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1862)" >Anna, mute with shock, shook her head.</p>
<a id="p1863" name="p1863"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1863)" >"I'll find Andi," Irene said. "You have horses readied, for yourself and a companion as well. I want an escort."</p>
<a id="p1864" name="p1864"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1864)" >Irene ran into the courtyard. The night told its hour on her skin. In perhaps two hours the birds would begin their pre-dawn chorus. Except for the guards, the Imperial compound slept. </p>
<a id="p1865" name="p1865"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1865)" >Irene had a good idea where to find her painfully modest apprentice.</p>
<a id="p1866" name="p1866"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1866)" >A single lantern glowed in an interior room of the baths. Irene swept in like a thunder squall. "Andi! Out and dressed! Now!"</p>
<a id="p1867" name="p1867"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1867)" >Andi had been soaking, half asleep in the warm water. The apprentice gasped, floundered wildly for a towel and missed.</p>
<a id="p1868" name="p1868"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1868)" >"Come on, girl," Irene said sharply. "You haven't got anything I haven't seen in the mirror." She stepped forward, grabbing up the towel. Andi rose from the bath and faced her.</p>
<a id="p1869" name="p1869"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1869)" >Irene stared. "I take that back."</p>
<a id="p1870" name="p1870"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1870)" >"Here," she said. She snapped the towel at Andi's offending anatomy. Andi gasped and made a frantic grab and Irene tossed him the rest of the towel. "We'll discuss <i>that</i> later," she said. "Get dressed. We're needed at the menagerie."</p>
<a id="p1871" name="p1871"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1871)" >Andi scrambled into his tunic&#151;high-necked to cover the Adam's apple in his throat, extra padding to suggest small breasts where none existed. As Andi yanked the garment into place, Irene grasped him by the arm. "What did you do to the Black Beast?"</p>
<a id="p1872" name="p1872"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1872)" >Andi met her eyes. "I poisoned him."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1873" name="p1873"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1873)" > The Black Beast lay on his side, panting, tongue rolling swollen and grey from the gaping beak. The glossy scales were dulled, and rustled like a fall of dry leaves with the creature's labored breathing. His injured hind leg was swollen and hot, the bandage crusted yellow.</p>
<a id="p1874" name="p1874"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1874)" >"What did you do to my Beast?" Tulius raged, following them into the cell. Irene spun on her heel. Her calloused palm struck out, with all her considerable strength behind it. Tulius staggered back, wheezing as he tried to pull air back into his diaphragm. "Shut up!" Irene shouted, stalking after him, stiffened fingers jabbing repeatedly at his chest. "The Empress said the Black Beast was yours&#151;<i>unless the circumstances changed</i>. Well, for now, they <i>have</i> changed. The Black Beast is sick, and sick animals are <i>mine</i>." She snapped her head towards Anna and Catullus, waiting just outside the door. "Get a transport wagon. This animal is too ill to remain here. We're moving it to the Imperial Mews. And while you're at it," she added, indicating Tulius with a thrust of her chin, "get that . . . person . . . out of here so we can work."</p>
<a id="p1875" name="p1875"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1875)" >Tulius, still wheezing, turned an even darker red, but was not prepared to argue with the two armed and determined palace guards. Catullus hustled Tulius away, and Anna pulled the cedar door closed, leaving Irene and Andi alone with the Beast.</p>
<a id="p1876" name="p1876"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1876)" >Irene checked the beast, sedated him to damp his pain. "You realize you could have killed this animal."</p>
<a id="p1877" name="p1877"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1877)" >"It was going to die in the arena," Andi said, cutting away the bandage. "I thought I could keep him sick long enough for the barbarian prince to come and go. Then maybe the Empress would intervene."</p>
<a id="p1878" name="p1878"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1878)" >Irene nodded begrudgingly. "All right. It makes sense, in a twisted sort of way. But if you ever do anything like this again, I'll geld you myself."</p>
<a id="p1879" name="p1879"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1879)" >Andi colored, but his hands continued to move, baring the wound, purging the poisoned flesh. "My father, my teachers&#151;they all said, Irene is the best there is&#151;perhaps the best that's ever been. I <i>had</i> to work with you, to be able to see, to study, creatures like Goldie. I <i>knew</i> I was good enough. But everyone said that only women and eunuchs get positions at the palace." He glanced at her. "You know that's true."</p>
<a id="p1880" name="p1880"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1880)" >"True enough," Irene admitted. She stroked the beast, its neck warm beneath her hand. The scales had a pattern of striations running out from a central vein, giving them a silky feel. In the oblique lantern light, they looked like feathers.</p>
<a id="p1881" name="p1881"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1881)" >The puppy-thoughts in Irene's head suddenly caught their tails. <i>Are his scales specialized feathers, or her feathers specialized scales?</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1882" name="p1882"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1882)" >The Black Beast had not reacted to Andi, but to Goldie's scent on Andi's flesh. His vocalizations had played upon her memory because they were echoes of Goldie's. In size, in the shape of body, beak and talons, the Black Beast was Goldie's mate, yet his lack of wings had deceived her&#151;until now.</p>
<a id="p1883" name="p1883"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1883)" >"I didn't even want to <i>pretend</i> to be a eunuch," Andi said. "So I pretended to be a woman." He smeared Beastie's wound with Varangian goo. "It wasn't that hard. Except I had to shave a lot."</p>
<a id="p1884" name="p1884"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1884)" >"Don't worry," Irene whispered. She stroked the beast, shaking. "When this animal is healthy again, you'll be so indispensable that no one will care whether you're a whole man or a bearded lady." She laughed. "There's adequate precedence for both."</p>
<a id="p1885" name="p1885"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1885)" >There was a soft knock. Anna eased the door open. "Mistress Irene, the wagon is ready."</p>
<a id="p1886" name="p1886"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1886)" >Irene stood. "I want this animal taken directly to the griffin's aerie. We'll bed it in the antechamber."</p>
<a id="p1887" name="p1887"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1887)" >"The aerie?" Andi asked, startled.</p>
<a id="p1888" name="p1888"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1888)" >Irene felt the grin stretching her face. "Don't you see it, Andi? You aren't the only gentleman who's been traveling incognito. This Black Beast is a male griffin&#151;<i>and griffins are on the list</i>."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p1889" name="p1889"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1889)" >"We think the sexes are highly specialized," Irene explained to the Princess Helena. "The female hunts, but it is the male, with his scales and superior strength, who guards the nesting site. Lions have a similar arrangement."</p>
<a id="p1890" name="p1890"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1890)" >"Certain fish, also," Andi put in. "And the sea horse, Your Highness. The male guards the eggs and young."</p>
<a id="p1891" name="p1891"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1891)" >"Ah," Helena said, graciously inclining her head. "Androcles, is it not? Your Mistress tells me We have you to thank for the Dark Emperor's survival, and the Dark Emperor for the return of Goldie's health." She smiled. "I am very grateful."</p>
<a id="p1892" name="p1892"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1892)" >Andi bowed.</p>
<a id="p1893" name="p1893"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1893)" >The Princess turned her eyes back to the aerie, where the two griffins lounged side by side in the warm sand, necks twined as human lovers twine arms. Andi, dismissed, went back to work.</p>
<a id="p1894" name="p1894"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1894)" >"A whole man for an apprentice," the Princess mused, loud enough for Andi to overhear. "Very daring, Irene."</p>
<a id="p1895" name="p1895"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1895)" >Irene startled. "How did you know . . . ?"</p>
<a id="p1896" name="p1896"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1896)" >The Princess smirked. "How did I know he wasn't a eunuch? How does a mare know a stallion from a gelding? Honestly, Irene, if you have to ask that, you've been celibate too long." Helena cast an appraising eye on Andi, not bothering to be subtle about it. Irene felt a flush creeping up her neck.</p>
<a id="p1897" name="p1897"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1897)" >"He has very good bones," Helena observed, "but he's awfully thin, and he works hard. I suppose he must be exhausted by the end of the day." She lifted a sympathetic brow. "Really, my dear, don't you want me to send you one of my Varangians?"</p>
<a id="p1898" name="p1898"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1898)" >The Princess Helena completely misinterpreted Andi's laughter, but that, Irene thought, was probably just as well.</p>
<a id="p1899" name="p1899"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1899)" >&nbsp;</p>
