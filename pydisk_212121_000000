<h2 class="chapter">82</h2>

<p>They did not come that night. Nor did they come the next though
they sent a lot of Taglians and Jaicuri out in place of the
Company.</p>

<p>Two mornings later Mather finally let me in on what the
excitement had been about when Blade interrupted our discussion
over Uncle Doj and Thai Dei. He told me, &ldquo;Croaker will be
here in an hour or two, Murgen. You might put in a good
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not an hour and it was not just the Old Man. Croaker was
travelling with the Prahbrindrah Drah himself. He looked like he
had seen a lot of hard road. I moved toward him in fits and starts,
unsure where we stood after all this time.</p>

<p>He jumped down, said, &ldquo;It is me. I&rsquo;m
real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I saw you die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You saw me get hit. I was still breathing when you
cut out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah? The shape you was in, there wasn&rsquo;t no
way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have
been, either. It&rsquo;s a long story. We can chew on it over a few
beers sometime.&rdquo; He waved. A soldier trotted up. Croaker
grabbed his spear, which was almost long enough to be a pike,
shoved it at me. &ldquo;Here. You left this when you ran off to
play Widowmaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not believe it. Not at first. It was the lance for the
standard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really need to hug it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really it! I was almost sure it was
lost.&rdquo; Despite what I had told Mogaba. &ldquo;You got no idea
how guilty I felt. Although I did think I saw it that one
time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s really you?&rdquo; I
looked at him closely. Having seen what illusions One-Eye and
Goblin could conjure I was not quite ready to accept the evidence
of my own eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Really. Alive and in a mood to kick some
ass. But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;ve got on my mind right now.
Where&rsquo;s Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor boy. Blade gave him the bad news. His paramour had left
more than a week ago, headed north. They missed each other on the
road.</p>

<p>Swan and Mather were impressed by the presence of the Prince,
their supposed boss. Why was he out running around, anyway? I
noticed Croaker had a hard stare for Sindhu, who had stayed behind
when Lady left.</p>

<p>The Old Man snapped, &ldquo;Quit making love to that damned
thing, Murgen. I need to catch up. I&rsquo;m way out of touch. Will
somebody take this damned butt-cruncher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soldier grabbed his mount&rsquo;s reins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to hear your story,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;While
it&rsquo;s fresh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to put it into the Annals? You been keeping them
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried. Only I had to leave them in the city.&rdquo; I
did not like that, either. One-Eye could promise the moon about
taking care of them but would he deliver?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look forward to reading the Book of Murgen. If
it&rsquo;s any good you&rsquo;ve got the job for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swan said something about Lady planning to write a book of her
own when she got time. Croaker flung a stone at a crow. It was the
first of those birds I had spotted since the albino in the night.
Maybe he brought it with him. I sketched some of what had been
happening in Dejagore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess it hasn&rsquo;t been fun for anybody. Seems Mogaba
is the main problem. Better get right after him. How many people
are still over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My guess is him and the Nar have a thousand to fifteen
hundred men. I don&rsquo;t know how many people I have. Some come
out every night but since I got elected prisoner here I can&rsquo;t
keep track. Goblin and One-Eye and most of the Company are still
over there.&rdquo; I hoped Uncle Doj and Thai Dei were using this
distraction to get To Tan and Sahra and themselves on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would they stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to leave. They say they want to
wait till Lady gets all her powers back. They say something is out
here waiting for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Powers back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; Blade said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunh. So what are they afraid of, Murgen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shapeshifter&rsquo;s apprentice. That bitch from Juniper.
She almost got One-Eye once already
once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; How come I believed the
little rat now but had not when he had told me?</p>

<p>I had a momentary vision of One-Eye puffing through the night
with fanged death closing in. It was as solid as actual memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember her. She was a real piece of work. Marron Shed
should have taken care of her when he had the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently she wants to get even with us for doing
Shifter. She may be locked into the forvalaka shape, too. Which
would really piss anybody off, I guess. But if you was to ask my
personal opinion I think she&rsquo;s only an excuse. They want to
stay where they are because otherwise they might have to leave
something behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shrugged. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Goblin and One-Eye.
They&rsquo;ve had months to pilfer and profiteer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Mogaba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now we got down to the grim stuff.</p>

<p>Before the discussion ended even nasty Sindhu condemned the
Nar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put an end to that. You want to take a message
to Mogaba?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked over my shoulder. He could not be asking the guy behind
me. There was nobody there. &ldquo;You shitting me? Not unless
it&rsquo;s an order. And maybe not then. Mogaba wants my head. Not
to mention my heart and liver for breakfast. Crazy as he is right
now he might go after me with you standing right behind
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get somebody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Swan volunteered. Then him and
Mather got into an argument about that. Evidently Swan had
something to prove to himself and Cordy did not believe he needed
to bother.</p>
