<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_11"></a><b>ELEVEN</b></h1>
<a id="p956" name="p956"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(956)">I lay belly down under the very dubious shelter of a bush, my head pointing downslope toward the car I could not see as long as the distort shield was up. The rain water ran down my back, gathered in the hollow of my belt when I moved, and then, in sudden icy jerks, trickled down over hips and thighs. Though it was summer and the days were warm enough, this stormy night held the threat of coming autumn, and I wanted nothing so much as to be under cover. Yet the sign of that flitter had made me doubly cautious. Any signal I gave those waiting below might betray us.</p>
<a id="p957" name="p957"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(957)">Cupping my hands about my torch, I made a funnel so the ray I needed would be hidden to anything above, though no flyer with a grain of sense would keep a light-bodied flitter aloft amid such tossing winds.</p>
<a id="p958" name="p958"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(958)">Now I pressed the button on, off, on, off. As far as I could see they ought to be able to pick up those flashes easily. But when nothing moved below, uneasiness boiled in me, and I was ready to go charging down with a stunner. My ever-present fear was that they had attempted to signal the flitter with the car com, and if they had been successful, who knew now what we might have to face.</p>
<a id="p959" name="p959"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(959)">There was a flickering below, and then the dark bulk of the car came into view. No lights on in it&#151;so my warnings had taken root to that extent! I got to my feet and went down, dragging my heavy bag.</p>
<a id="p960" name="p960"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(960)">"Vere?" Annet's voice in anxious inquiry.</p>
<a id="p961" name="p961"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(961)">"Yes!" I scrambled to the door. "Let me in&#151;quick!"</p>
<a id="p962" name="p962"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(962)">I thrust myself in as I might have charged an enemy-occupied room. There were startled protests as I forced a place for my wet self.</p>
<a id="p963" name="p963"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(963)">"That flitter&#151;you did not com it?" I leaned across Annet to thumb up the distort once again, only breathing easily when that defense was on.</p>
<a id="p964" name="p964"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(964)">"No," Thad answered. "You said&#151;"</p>
<a id="p965" name="p965"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(965)">"Why shouldn't we?" Annet's demand overrode his answer. "He held the mike where I couldn't reach it, or I would have. Why&#151;what has happened, Vere?"</p>
<a id="p966" name="p966"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(966)">I was so tired I could no longer fence. After all, they were going to find out sooner or later, and they should have been bright enough to guess for themselves with all the clues we had had.</p>
<a id="p967" name="p967"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(967)">"I found a dead town," I replied flatly.</p>
<a id="p968" name="p968"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(968)">"You mean everyone gone?" She sounded more startled&#151;disbelieving. "But where did they go&#151;to the port, over the mountains?"</p>
<a id="p969" name="p969"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(969)">"I said dead, not deserted. A town of the dead&#151;"</p>
<a id="p970" name="p970"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(970)">I felt her stir beside me, as if she cringed away to the extent anyone could move on the overcrowded seat.</p>
<a id="p971" name="p971"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(971)">"But how&#151;killed?"</p>
<a id="p972" name="p972"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(972)">"Those I&#151;I looked at showed no signs of laser or blaster. They had apparently just dropped at their duty posts. But the town is dead. And its store has been looted at a later time. I brought two stunners&#151;the rest of the weapons are gone."</p>
<a id="p973" name="p973"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(973)">"Then Lugard was right!" Thad cut in. "The refugees attacked&#151;but why kill everyone?"</p>
<a id="p974" name="p974"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(974)">"No!" Annet was shivering. "No! It can't be true! Vere, we've got to get back to Kynvet. Take a flitter&#151;there must be flitters at Feeholme."</p>
<a id="p975" name="p975"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(975)">"There were flitters. Someone systematically destroyed them. Lasers had been used on those&#151;on hoppers, too. There is no workable transportation left."</p>
<a id="p976" name="p976"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(976)">"Then&#151;then what are we going to do? Dagny&#151;"</p>
<a id="p977" name="p977"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(977)">"We have this car, and I brought all the supplies I could that were light and yet highly sustaining. Our best move now is to head back into the Reserve&#151;cross the mountains&#151;"</p>
<a id="p978" name="p978"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(978)">"That flitter&#151;" Thad asked. "Do you suppose it was the looters?"</p>
<a id="p979" name="p979"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(979)">"It could be our people, hunting survivors," Annet said. "If it was and we didn't com them&#151;" Her tone was accusing.</p>
<a id="p980" name="p980"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(980)">"Did you ever see a normal flitter following such a flight pattern?" Thad asked for me. "There was something wrong with the machine or the pilot. Do we go back the way we came, Vere?"</p>
<a id="p981" name="p981"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(981)">It was a temptation. There was the Ranger headquarters where we could find shelter, perhaps use it for a base while we scouted a possible route over the mountains again. However, it might well be that any structure would serve as a magnet for looters. There were maps in plenty; they could have found one in Feeholme that located every station in the Reserves.</p>
<a id="p982" name="p982"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(982)">"I think not. We strike due southeast from here, into the hill country. There is a reception point for mutants at Gur Horn. We can head for that&#151;perhaps pick up more supplies there."</p>
<a id="p983" name="p983"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(983)">We would go nowhere this night, however, uncomfortable as it would be; rather we would try to shelter and rest in the car. I was in no mind to switch on driving lights, which would be beacons in the dark. Rough cross-country travel was impossible, and to seek the roads was to ask for discovery. I thought Annet would raise opposition to this decision, but she did not. Instead, she set about reorganizing our seating so as to give maximum comfort in our minimum of space. Some of the food was shared out.</p>
<a id="p984" name="p984"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(984)">We slept, I think out of sheer fatigue. Twice I was awakened by cries from the sleeping children and knew that they dreamed. But I did not, and for that I was thankful. Annet was quick to soothe and comfort. The last time, when Pritha whimpered herself half awake, Annet reached out her hand as if seeking support, and I grasped it. There was no other sound from Pritha, but Annet turned her face nearer mine and whispered, "Vere, <i>can</i> we get over the mountains?"</p>
<a id="p985" name="p985"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(985)">"If we take one step at a time, we can. This is summer; the Reserve pass will be open. If we use that, we shall come out not too far from Butte Hold." Then I hesitated, remembering those visitors Lugard had faced down with a far more formidable weapon than any we possessed. If a hint of treasure had drawn them to the Butte, they might be there now, hunting for Lugard's rumored find.</p>
<a id="p986" name="p986"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(986)">"Vere&#151;" Her whisper was now such a thin thread of sound I could hardly hear it. "There was something&#151;"</p>
<a id="p987" name="p987"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(987)">"What?" I prompted when she did not continue.</p>
<a id="p988" name="p988"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(988)">"You know, at Yetholme, they did controlled experiments for the forces." I could hear her swallow as if the words were being forced out of her.</p>
<a id="p989" name="p989"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(989)">"That was years back, and didn't they close down entirely?"</p>
<a id="p990" name="p990"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(990)">"Everyone said so. Dr. Corfu&#151;you know what he did."</p>
<a id="p991" name="p991"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(991)">"Took a double cold-sleep pill and never came out of it."</p>
<a id="p992" name="p992"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(992)">"He&#151;he wouldn't go ahead with their last experiment, and they pressured him terribly. I heard Mother&#151;she had seen the initial steps. They were working on a mutated virus. Vere, it would kill off intelligent beings&#151;it affected the brain&#151;but it left a world intact, to be taken over later by jump troops. It had no affect on animals unless they were specially sensitized to it. Vere, what if&#151;?"</p>
<a id="p993" name="p993"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(993)">Again I remembered one of Lugard's warnings. There might be secrets here which would-be raiders would welcome as part of their armament for future attacks. A virus with such properties, seeded in secret across an unsuspecting city, even a continent, or a world, a period of waiting&#151;then easy picking for the seeders. But a virus&#151;my hand caught at the latch of the car door&#151;if such a thing had been loosed in Feeholme, then I could now be a carrier, already a dead man myself! Perhaps it was too late for all of us. I had spent the night here, in close quarters, breathed the same air, touched them. They could all be dead because of me!</p>
<a id="p994" name="p994"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(994)">Those in the town had died so quickly and at their posts that my guess had been some type of gas loosed off to blanket the settlement. Would a plague have worked in that manner?</p>
<a id="p995" name="p995"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(995)">"I might have&#151;"</p>
<a id="p996" name="p996"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(996)">"No. You said they had been dead for some time." Her whisper was ragged.</p>
<a id="p997" name="p997"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(997)">"Yes."</p>
<a id="p998" name="p998"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(998)">"What they worked on at Yetholme was a forty-eight-hour strike. Then the virus died, unless someone came too soon. And there were immune shots. If we could find records, we would know. But you can't take this car up to the pass, can you?"</p>
<a id="p999" name="p999"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(999)">"No. But we shall use it as far as we can. Gur Horn first. If I remember rightly, there was never more than a small staff there. It was a mutant introduction point, and all they did was watch over the high types. They may have been summoned just as the other Rangers were. We can get more supplies there, shelter. It is the highest of the permanent Reserve bases."</p>
<a id="p1000" name="p1000"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1000)">"What mutants were there?"</p>
<a id="p1001" name="p1001"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1001)">"I don't know. The time we visited Anlav, we didn't go there. They simply informed us as to what it was when we sighted it from the flitter."</p>
<a id="p1002" name="p1002"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1002)">"Would the staff have transportation?"</p>
<a id="p1003" name="p1003"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1003)">"A hopper maybe, a ground car certainly. They had to be ready to transport injured animals for treatment. There was always the danger of a mutant being attacked by a control. And in order to study them properly, they couldn't keep them penned or caged."</p>
<a id="p1004" name="p1004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1004)">A hopper, yes, we might just find a hopper there. And that would lighten our mountain journey by about half. I found myself impatient to set out for Gur Horn.</p>
<a id="p1005" name="p1005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1005)">The storm blew itself out by dawn. And as soon as we had light enough to see before us, I put the car on steady power, though that was drained by the energy to keep up the distort, which was never intended to run steadily. These cars were meant for very rough usage, but I had no idea how long or how far their unit charges would take them. We might be put afoot before we reached our goal, though I tried to make the best time possible.</p>
<a id="p1006" name="p1006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1006)">Luckily, the southeastern way took us mainly across open country. It was rolling, though, with an up-and-down hillock route, which, before noon, forced us twice to pause when Pritha and Ifors became ill from the motion. Dagny lay inert, wedged in with blanket rolls. She ate and drank, but she lay with her eyes closed, and Annet could not tell whether she slept or was in a stupor.</p>
<a id="p1007" name="p1007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1007)">We nooned beside a small stream, eating E-rations rather than trying to heat any food. The sun was hot outside the car, and it bore down on one's head and burned any exposed portion of skin. We did not tarry long, and I filled all our canteens before we pulled out. I had no notion of water supply in the hills to which we were pointed.</p>
<a id="p1008" name="p1008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1008)">Those grew higher about us, and I had to find a twisting path among them instead of taking an upgrade and downgrade route as I had before. It seemed I was right about the lack of water, for the terrain grew more and more desert. Storm waters had torn through gullies, leaving drift behind, and our progress grew slower and slower. Then we hit upon a cleared trail that could only be that to Gur Horn, and recklessly I turned into it, determined we must make speed.</p>
<a id="p1009" name="p1009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1009)">Distances as seen from the air and the ground vary a great deal. When we had flown this route on the instruction trip, it had seemed that the mutant station was a very short space removed from Ranger headquarters and that both were about within shouting distance of Feeholme. Now I wondered if I had mistaken the way and missed Gur Horn, to travel lost into the hills.</p>
<a id="p1010" name="p1010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1010)">We moved down an alley between high-growing spiggan bushes. Since it was fruiting time for those, the branches were so loaded with their purple burden that they bent far ground-ward, and our road was crowded. Insects, from small ones to those large Zand moths that I could not cover with my hand, wore their brilliant wings outspread as they clung to the overripe and rotting berries already fallen in a mucky carpet across ground and road. There were birds in plenty, and here and there small animals that had glutted themselves into a drunken stupor and lay, some on their backs, their limp paws pointed skyward as they slept off their indulgence. I knew it was good we drove enclosed, for the odor of the too ripe fruit was nothing anyone would want to smell twice.</p>
<a id="p1011" name="p1011"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1011)">We were away from the far end of this feasting place when I stopped, for the creature standing in the middle of the way facing us had not fed here, and its stance now could only be explained by the fact that it not only saw us (though how could that be with the distort on?) but also that it wanted to halt us purposefully.</p>
<a id="p1012" name="p1012"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1012)">"An ystroben!" Gytha leaned forward until her head was level with my shoulder. "Vere, it's an ystroben!"</p>
<a id="p1013" name="p1013"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1013)">At first sight I would have agreed with her. It had the thick red fur, the rounded head, the fan-shaped, fur-edged ears, the rounded muzzle, the black paws, and the stub tail. Yet there were differences, and the longer one stared at the animal, the more apparent those differences became. In the first place, the head&#151;it had a higher and wider dome of skull. Also, it was larger than any ystroben I had ever seen. And it was far from timid. Also&#151;it saw us!</p>
<a id="p1014" name="p1014"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1014)">"Vere, it wants us to do something&#151;see!"</p>
<a id="p1015" name="p1015"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1015)">Had I not watched what happened, I would not have believed, for the beast arose from its plump haunches, came a little farther toward us, and deliberately raised a forepaw to beckon. There was no mistaking that gesture&#151;it <i>had</i> beckoned.</p>
<a id="p1016" name="p1016"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1016)">"A mutant!"</p>
<a id="p1017" name="p1017"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1017)">"It wants us to do something," Gytha repeated, emphasizing that with a firm grip on my shoulder.</p>
<a id="p1018" name="p1018"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1018)">"But"&#151;Annet's hand went out to touch the lever among the controls&#151;"the distort is on. How can it see us?"</p>
<a id="p1019" name="p1019"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1019)">"If it is a mutant," Gytha retorted, "it can do all sorts of things. Vere, we must see what it wants."</p>
<a id="p1020" name="p1020"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1020)">But I had no mind to play games with animals. And mutants could be untrustworthy. Who knows what could be roaming about now, freed from some lab control by the failure of a dead man's hand to touch the right buttons?</p>
<a id="p1021" name="p1021"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1021)">I activated one of the safety devices of the car. And, while we felt nothing at all, the things feeding on the berries seemed to go mad. Those that flew and could still depend upon their wings and their equilibration arose in the air, some so sharply that they collided. And the four-footed ones still conscious rolled on the ground or ran as fast as their legs could carry them, scattering from the vicinity of the car as if that had exploded.</p>
<a id="p1022" name="p1022"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1022)">The ystroben shuddered and strove to stay where it was, making a visibly great effort to do so. Then, its mouth opened in what must have been a shriek, though whether of rage or pain we could not hear within our soundproof cocoon. And it fell to its four feet, to weave drunkenly off the center, staggering into the wall of bushes.</p>
<a id="p1023" name="p1023"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1023)">"What did you do?" Thad asked.</p>
<a id="p1024" name="p1024"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1024)">"Sonics&#151;used to ward off animal attack."</p>
<a id="p1025" name="p1025"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1025)">Gytha's hand on my shoulder became a fist, which she brought down with bruising impact on my flesh.</p>
<a id="p1026" name="p1026"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1026)">"You didn't have to do that!" she cried. "It wasn't going to hurt us. It wanted us to do something&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1027" name="p1027"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1027)">I closed my ears to her protest and stepped up the speed of the car, wanting to be out of the overpopulated bush as quickly as we could. We came into an open space where there was more luxuriant growth than we had seen for hours. The reason for that was plain, for a fountain played on a level space, and from it flowed a stream, to reach a little hollow, puddle into a pond, and again seek a way on a pebbled bed until it was swallowed up by reeds and water-loving vegetation.</p>
<a id="p1028" name="p1028"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1028)">Beyond the fountain was another of the artfully constructed houses blended with care into the landscape. Behind that soared the unusual formation of rock that gave it its name&#151;Gur Horn, for that towering spear of stone was indeed shaped to the fashion of a gur horn, even having the spiraled markings one sees on the adult male of the species.</p>
<a id="p1029" name="p1029"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1029)">We had come so suddenly into the open that I had no time for any hide and scout precautions I wanted to take. But there was no sign of life, and the parking space to the side of the house housed not even a ground car.</p>
<a id="p1030" name="p1030"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1030)">I pushed off the distort, and instantly the world was alive with the noise it had cloaked. Noise it was&#151;a mournful lowering, a moaning, and now and then a scream or rumble or growl, all of which seemed to come from the house.</p>
<a id="p1031" name="p1031"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1031)">"What&#151;?" Annet had her stunner ready.</p>
<a id="p1032" name="p1032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1032)">I had been about to open the door; now I hesitated. The amount of that sound and its plaint suggested trouble, bad trouble. Yet I could see nothing moving.</p>
<a id="p1033" name="p1033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1033)">"Vere, the ystroben&#151;" Gytha demanded my attention, pulling at the arm she had bruised minutes earlier. I turned my head in the direction she pointed. The animal that had tried to withstand the sonic, or its close twin, staggered out of the berry-walled lane. Its eyes were half closed; it shook its head from side to side as if it had been deafened. But doggedly it kept on its feet and passed us, heading for the house. Now it was uttering sounds, too, a kind of rumbling, and the other cries began to subside.</p>
<a id="p1034" name="p1034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1034)">"Vere, look! It's asking you again!"</p>
<a id="p1035" name="p1035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1035)">It had reached the level of the fountain and was standing there, its flanks heaving, its mouth hanging a little open as if the effort that had brought it so far was exhausting. Now it did indeed balance its weight on three paws, raise the fourth, a fore one, to make a clumsy beckoning gesture.</p>
<a id="p1036" name="p1036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1036)">There was no denying its urgency. And somehow I could not. But as I slid through the door with stunner in hand, I gave orders sharply.</p>
<a id="p1037" name="p1037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1037)">"No one follow. Close this after me, and wait for an all-clear sign. If I don't show again promptly, take off&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1038" name="p1038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1038)">I did not give them time to protest but slammed the door and started warily toward the fountain. The ystroben, seeing that I was on my way, seemed satisfied. It turned and made, not for the house which I first thought its goal, but to the right. And I hurried after it.</p>
<a id="p1039" name="p1039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1039)">There I found the beginning of tragedy. There must have been a shipment of mutants from some lab just before whatever devastated our world struck. They had been housed in pen cages for eventual release into the Reserve and then, apparently, forgotten. No food, no water, and there were some pitiful bodies on the ground that testified that, for some, release would now come too late. The ystroben hunkered down, its nose against the wire of an end cage. And there within was another of its species lying on its side. It tried to raise its head at the coming of its comrade and failed.</p>
<a id="p1040" name="p1040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1040)">One look told me there was no danger here for us but much to be done. I hailed those in the car, and soon we were all busy opening cages, carrying food from the containers in view, which must have been an added torment to the animals, and water in pails from the fountain.</p>
<a id="p1041" name="p1041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1041)">Some of those already lying prostrate were still alive, and we worked over them. Those first to recover went down the hill into the wilds of the Reserve. For the others we left cage doors wedged open and plenty of food and water, to let them recover at their own rate of speed. Five were dead.</p>
<a id="p1042" name="p1042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1042)">The house was deserted, with the same signs of haste the Ranger headquarters had shown. To have gone with caged animals on the premises was so foreign to all training that I knew the need must have been great. Had some message gathered in all the outlying personnel to Feeholme where they could be conveniently disposed of? That was the only explanation I could see as logical.</p>
<a id="p1043" name="p1043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1043)">But this was not a house claimed by the dead, so we settled into it thankfully, though it had been intended only for a staff of two, and we found it crowded. What pleased me most was the discovery of a recharging unit on the wall abutting the parking space. We could spend a day, or a part of a day here, making sure that the power in the car was fully restored. I hoped we could continue to drive well into the heights.</p>
<a id="p1044" name="p1044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1044)">"Vere"&#151;Gytha came up as I was studying the charge dials and trying to remember the necessary steps for a full hookup&#151;"these animals, they're all mutants, aren't they?"</p>
<a id="p1045" name="p1045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1045)">"I think so."</p>
<a id="p1046" name="p1046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1046)">"How smart are they?"</p>
<a id="p1047" name="p1047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1047)">I shrugged. Without lab reports how could anyone estimate? The ystroben had certainly displayed intelligence in its struggle to win our aid for the caged ones. We had all heard tales, of course, of the beast teams&#151;mixed collections of animals working with and under the director of a trained human leader. There had been some exciting stories of those out of the war. Survey and exploration were using, or had used, animal aides on newly discovered planets, the men depending on the keener senses of the animals. But not all mutants were successful telepaths, which was necessary in both beast team and survey work.</p>
<a id="p1048" name="p1048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1048)">There had been twenty beasts in those cages, of fifteen different species, some of which were totally new to me. Five were dead&#151;among them two of the unknowns. They would all be loose here now, but the tests they had been sent here to make would never be set up. I wished them well but thought they were no longer our problem.</p>
<a id="p1049" name="p1049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1049)">"I don't know&#151;maybe no one did," I said in answer to Gytha's question. "They could have been sent here for just that reason&#151;to discover what they could do," I told her as I began uncoiling the hookup wires.</p>
<a id="p1050" name="p1050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1050)">"Were&#151;are any of them dangerous?"</p>
<a id="p1051" name="p1051"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1051)">"No. They should all be conditioned. They will protect themselves, but they should not be aggressive. The normal wild ones, though, are not adjusted to man. There are some parts of the Reserves you never visit without distorts and sonics."</p>
<a id="p1052" name="p1052"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1052)">"That wart-horn&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1053" name="p1053"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1053)">For a moment I did not know what she was talking about, it was so long past.</p>
<a id="p1054" name="p1054"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1054)">"What wart-horn?"</p>
<a id="p1055" name="p1055"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1055)">"The one we saw on the Butte com. Vere, was that a mutant?"</p>
<a id="p1056" name="p1056"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1056)">"Couldn't have been. There was no work done with native animals that I ever heard of."</p>
<a id="p1057" name="p1057"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1057)">"But there could have been and not reported?"</p>
<a id="p1058" name="p1058"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1058)">"Anything is possible&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1059" name="p1059"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1059)">She was nodding vigorously. "You know, after the commandant left, when everyone said they were through working on war projects, a lot of the labs never reported to Center any more."</p>
<a id="p1060" name="p1060"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1060)">That was right. But why did the wart-horn bother her now I asked.</p>
<a id="p1061" name="p1061"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1061)">"I don't know. But Pritha keeps mentioning it. She said it was watching us, that it didn't like us&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1062" name="p1062"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1062)">"Even if that were so, which I don't believe," I replied, "that thing was over the mountains to the north and a long way from any place where there is any settlement now. It could be no danger to us."</p>
<a id="p1063" name="p1063"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1063)">"But, Vere, if everybody&#151;" She hesitated and then went on. "If everybody except us is dead, then the mutants&#151;they could be people, or like people in time, couldn't they?"</p>
<a id="p1064" name="p1064"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1064)">It was possible, but it was not a thought to dwell on.</p>
<a id="p1065" name="p1065"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1065)">"We cannot be sure all are dead," I told her firmly. "Tomorrow we shall do some scouting. As soon as we can map out the best trail up and over, we'll take it. You'll be back home before you know it."</p>
<a id="p1066" name="p1066"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1066)">"I don't want to be, Vere. Not if Kynvet is like Feeholme."</p>
<a id="p1067" name="p1067"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1067)">"Winter is coming; we must get home before the passes close," I continued as if I did not hear her, for I did not know any answer to an observation that matched my own feelings. It would be better to shelter at the Butte, or in a Reserve cabin, rather than return to a dead Kynvet. I knew that I could not take the children into a place of ghosts and expect them to stay. Not all parents had been so remote with their offspring as the Ahrens, and those who had had a closer family relationship must not be allowed to see what had happened if the fate of Feeholme had also been visited on Kynvet.</p>
<a id="p1068" name="p1068"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1068)">"Vere, look up there&#151;" She caught my hand and brought me half around to face the Gur Horn.</p>
<a id="p1069" name="p1069"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1069)">It had been put to good use by the Rangers, for the spur had been turned into a lookout to give a wide view of the surrounding country. Thad had climbed there at my suggestion not long before, and now he was waving vigorously, pointing north. I signaled to him to come down, hurrying to the foot of the climb pole to meet him.</p>
<a id="p1070" name="p1070"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1070)">"A flitter, crashed over on the hill due north&#151;" he gasped. "And it's afire!"</p>
<a id="p1071" name="p1071"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1071)">The one that had passed over us the night before? Crashed and afire&#151;there would be little hope for her crew.</p>
<a id="p1072" name="p1072"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1072)">"Sabian, the aid kit." Annet had come up behind us. "Thad, can we reach it by car?"</p>
<a id="p1073" name="p1073"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1073)">He shook his head doubtfully. "I don't know; it's pretty steep. But you might climb up&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1074" name="p1074"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1074)">"Where do you think you're going?" I demanded.</p>
<a id="p1075" name="p1075"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1075)">"To the people on board!" She looked at me as if I had grown wart-horns. "They are probably badly injured. We had better hurry."</p>
<a id="p1076" name="p1076"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1076)">And I could see that at that moment there was no argument I could raise that might move her.</p>
<a id="p1077" name="p1077"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1077)">&#160;</p>
