<h2 class="chapter">77</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow come
you&rsquo;re so crabby?&rdquo; Willow Swan demanded when I snapped
at him for no good reason. &ldquo;Rag time again
already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I blushed. Me, after twenty years among the crudest men on two
hooves. &ldquo;No, jerk. I didn&rsquo;t sleep very well last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It exploded out of him like the shriek of a stomped rat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep well last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Not our sweet little Sleepy. Guys, anybody, Ro,
River, whoever, you want to step up and remind us about the Roar in
the Rain last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riverwalker told me, &ldquo;Boss, your snoring made more noise
than a tiger in heat. We had people get up and move back up the
road toward home to get away from the racket. There were people
wanted to strangle you or at least put your head in a sack. I bet
if anybody else knew what the hell we were doing and where we were
going, you&rsquo;d be on that travois with General
Sindawe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m such a sweet, delicate flower. I
couldn&rsquo;t possibly snore.&rdquo; I had been accused of the
crime before but only jokingly, never with such passion.</p>

<p>River snorted. &ldquo;Swan decided not to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stricken. I&rsquo;ll see if One-Eye
doesn&rsquo;t have a cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cure? The man can&rsquo;t even take care of
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I scrounged up something to eat. It was barely worth the effort
and definitely not filling. We would be on short rations for a long
time. Before I finished what morning preparations were possible for
me, the forward elements were already moving. The general mood was
more relaxed. We had survived the night. And yesterday we had
shoved it to the Protector real good.</p>

<p>The relaxation ended when we found Bucket&rsquo;s remains.</p>

<p>Big Bucket, real name Cato Dahlia, once a thief, once an officer
of the Black Company, was almost a father to me. He never said and
I never asked but I suspect he knew I was female all along. He was
very unpleasant to some of my male relatives, way back when.</p>

<p>You did not want to be the object when Bucket got angry.</p>

<p>I managed not to break down. I had had a long time to get used
to the idea that he was gone, though there was always some small,
irrational hope that Murgen was wrong, that death had overlooked
him and he was buried with the Captured.</p>

<p>The men put Bucket on the travois with Sindawe without having to
be told.</p>

<p>I tagged along and became entranced by one of those
unaccountably irrelevant trains of thought that often take shape at
such times.</p>

<p>We had left a truly nasty mess where we had spent the night,
particularly in the line of animal waste. Likely the Captured had
done the same during their passage along this same road. However,
other than the odd corpse, there was no sign that they had passed
through. There were no dung piles now, no gnawed, discarded bones,
no vegetable waste, no ashes from charcoal braziers, nothing. Only
human bodies lasted and they became thoroughly desiccated.</p>

<p>I would have to take it up with Murgen. Meantime, it was a
mental exercise that would keep me from dwelling upon Bucket.</p>

<p>We trudged on southward. The rain came and went, never more than
a drizzle, though sometimes the wind brought it stinging in from a
sharp angle. I shivered a lot and worried about it getting cold
enough to sleet or snow. No other evil found us. Eventually I spied
the vague silhouette of our initial destination, that mysterious
central fortress.</p>

<p>The wind began to blow steadily.</p>

<p>Some of the men complained about the cold. Some complained about
the wet. Quite a few complained about the menu, and a handful
insisted on complaining about all the complaining, I sensed few
positive feelings concerning what we were doing.</p>

<p>I felt very much alone, almost abandoned, the whole day long
despite well-meant efforts from Swan, Sahra and quite a few others.
Only Uncle Doj did not bother because even at this late date he
remained piqued because I would not enlist as his apprentice. He
continued his emotional machinations. Several times I caught myself
retreating into my away place and had to remind me that I did not
need to go there now. None of those people could hurt me anymore.
Not if I did not let them. I controlled their reality. They
survived only in my memory&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Even that is immortality of a sort</em>.</p>

<p>We Vehdna believe in ghosts. And we believe in evil. I wondered
if the Gunni might not be onto something after all. For them the
pain inspired by the departure of loved ones is less personal and
far more fatalistic and is accepted as a necessary stage of life
that does not end with this one transformation.</p>

<p>If the Gunni, by some bizarre and remote practical joke of the
divine, happen to be in possession of a more accurate
theology, I must have been a bad, bad girl in a previous life. I
sure hope I had fun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Forgive me, O Lord of
the Hours, Who Art Merciful and Compassionate. I have sinned in my
heart. Thou Art God. There Can Be No Other.</p>
