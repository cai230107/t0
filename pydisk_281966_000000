<blockquote>
<a id="p6004" name="p6004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6004)" style="text-indent:0"><i>A Roman, divorced from his wife, being highly blamed by his friends, who demanded, </i>"<i>Was she not chaste? Was she not fair? Was she not fruitful?</i>" <i>holding out his shoe, asked them whether or not it was new and well made. </i>"<i>Yet,</i>" <i>added he, </i>"<i>none of you can tell where it pinches me.</i>"</p>
<a id="p6005" name="p6005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6005)" align="right" style="text-indent:0">&#151;Plutarch</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="p6006" name="p6006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6006)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p6007" name="p6007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6007)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p6008" name="p6008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6008)">Jason stood outside the great hall, waiting, until he decided he'd had enough of waiting. It didn't take long for him to have enough.</p>
<a id="p6009" name="p6009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6009)">There were three ceremonial guards at the door tonight: Durine, Kethol and Pirojil.</p>
<a id="p6010" name="p6010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6010)">"Let's do it," Jason said.</p>
<a id="p6011" name="p6011"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6011)">Pirojil started to protest that it was too early, but Durine shook his head and Kethol rapped the butt of his halberd on the stone.</p>
<a id="p6012" name="p6012"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6012)">"Ladies and gentlemen, the Heir."</p>
<a id="p6013" name="p6013"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6013)">Jason walked across the carpet, uncomfortable in his velvet finery. It didn't feel right.</p>
<a id="p6014" name="p6014"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6014)">But that didn't matter. Got to keep a sense of proportion about everything. Control what you can, and let the rest go.</p>
<a id="p6015" name="p6015"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6015)">He paused for a moment at the foot of the table. Mother's chair. He rested a hand on her shoulder for a moment. She was stronger every day. Just have to keep her away from that damn magic that threatened to drive her crazy. Her fingers gripped his with surprising strength.</p>
<a id="p6016" name="p6016"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6016)">Ellegon, tell my mother that I love her&#151; He stopped himself. She knew it.</p>
<a id="p6017" name="p6017"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6017)">To her right Walter Slovotsky and Kirah sat; to their right was Doria. A few days' rest had done Slovotsky a world of good; he looked a decade younger, and his I'm-so-clever-to-be-Walter-Slovotsky smile was perhaps a degree wider.</p>
<a id="p6018" name="p6018"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6018)">Ahira sat next to Doria, and the dwarf smiled broadly at him. He raised a clenched, hamlike fist to chest level, for just a moment, as though to say, Be strong<i>.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p6019" name="p6019"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6019)"><i>Count on it.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p6020" name="p6020"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6020)">Aeia was next to the dwarf. Jason had already talked to her about Bren Adahan; he didn't know what she'd decided to do about it, but that was her decision.</p>
<a id="p6021" name="p6021"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6021)">Flame flared noisily in the courtyard outside. *We all have to make our own decisions.*</p>
<a id="p6022" name="p6022"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6022)"><i>That we do.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p6023" name="p6023"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6023)">*Thomen is upset that you haven't discussed anything with him.*</p>
<a id="p6024" name="p6024"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6024)"><i>Tell him to sit still.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p6025" name="p6025"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6025)">"Good evening," Jason said as he walked to his seat at the head of the table. He looked over the assemblage of Holtish and Biemish barons, and their advisers. "Be seated, all. You have a full agenda; I have a short one. I'm going to stand.</p>
<a id="p6026" name="p6026"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6026)">"Tennetty&#151;" He tossed her the large brass key to the strongbox. "Get it, will you?"</p>
<a id="p6027" name="p6027"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6027)">"Your high&#151;"</p>
<a id="p6028" name="p6028"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6028)">"Shut <i>up, </i>Thomen," Jason said. "I'm going to speak my piece, then you can talk all you want.</p>
<a id="p6029" name="p6029"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6029)">"First item of business," he said. "Thomen, you've got too much to do, what with managing the Empire, sitting in court and all. I'm taking your barony away from you."</p>
<a id="p6030" name="p6030"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6030)">It was just as well that Thomen's mother, Beralyn, wasn't there. Of course, that wasn't by accident&#151;Jason had ordered that she absent herself from council. Probably the last time he'd be able to do that.</p>
<a id="p6031" name="p6031"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6031)">Thomen Furnael was white-lipped. "And who are you giving it to?"</p>
<a id="p6032" name="p6032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6032)"><i>Tell him to keep his mouth shut, and make him.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p6033" name="p6033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6033)">*As you wish, Jason.*</p>
<a id="p6034" name="p6034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6034)">"Me. It's Barony Cullinane, as of now. I've always wanted a barony. I'm going to have Lou and Petros send over a team of engineers to manage it for me. And&#151;oh, thank you, Tennetty," he said, taking the bag containing the crown and tossing it casually to the table. "Garavar, I'm releasing Durine, Kethol and Pirojil from their oaths to you and the crown, and hiring them. I want to have them around me when I'm there.</p>
<a id="p6035" name="p6035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6035)">"Next matter," he said. "The Other Siders." Slovotsky pushed his chair back. "Go ahead, Uncle Walter."</p>
<a id="p6036" name="p6036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6036)">Walter Slovotsky drained his wine glass and stood. "You folks expect a lot of us Other Siders," he said. "Which is fair enough. The ones that Deighton sent over are all pretty special, and I've long since given up on believing that there's any coincidence in that.</p>
<a id="p6037" name="p6037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6037)">"But we can't do everything. I don't build things. Ahira can't work magic&#151;and you'll notice that the Engineer doesn't go around trying to get his ass killed, the way Karl used to. Andy came close to burning herself out by pushing her abilities too far too fast.</p>
<a id="p6038" name="p6038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6038)">"We can't do everything, but you've been expecting that we can. It's one of the reasons that I was able to keep the legend of Karl alive longer than we could keep Karl alive. The kind of magic that lets somebody do everything doesn't exist." Slovotsky sat down. "It's all yours, kid."</p>
<a id="p6039" name="p6039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6039)">"Which leads us to the last thing on my agenda," Jason said. "I can't do everything, people. And neither could my father. He tried to be everything&#151;prince, emperor, father, husband, warrior&#151;and he fell flat on his face too often.</p>
<a id="p6040" name="p6040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6040)">"His mistake was letting you people put the crown on his head. How many times has one of you said to him, 'An emperor has no business doing this or that?' Garavar, how many times?"</p>
<a id="p6041" name="p6041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6041)">The old general muffled a smile.</p>
<a id="p6042" name="p6042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6042)">*He's figured it out.*</p>
<a id="p6043" name="p6043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6043)">"But you didn't really believe it, Garavar. It was a joke to you, sometimes. You thought he could get away with whatever he did. You were wrong. He couldn't do everything, and neither can I. The difference is that I'm going to pick what I do. And I will do it very well."</p>
<a id="p6044" name="p6044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6044)">He unwrapped the crown and stood. "Thomen, you've been governing the Empire since my father left to try to save my life. You put the realm first." Jason let his fingers run across the polished silver, resting lightly on the coolness of the central emerald. "About time we stop pretending that it takes a Cullinane to govern." He faced the barons. "Any of you Biemish who thinks this means the Empire's abandoning the plan of raising the Holts to full citizen status had better think again; it was Thomen's idea in the first place. Any of you Holts who think now'd be a real good time to revolt can speak now," he said, letting his hand drop to the butt of his pistol.</p>
<a id="p6045" name="p6045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6045)">Jason waited in the silence. "I didn't think so."</p>
<a id="p6046" name="p6046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6046)">"And what are you going to do?" Tyrnael asked.</p>
<a id="p6047" name="p6047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6047)">"Change the world, Baron," Jason said. There was a friend of his, somewhere out in the Middle Lands, looking for the man that had enslaved him and his family. That was a good place to start.</p>
<a id="p6048" name="p6048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6048)">"I've got some partners to work with, some teachers to<i> </i>learn from," he said, nodding toward Slovotsky and the dwarf, who smiled back as they pushed their chairs away from the table and stood.</p>
<a id="p6049" name="p6049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6049)">Slovotsky shrugged. "I'm going to start by teaching him how to drink," he said.</p>
<a id="p6050" name="p6050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6050)">"Sit still, Thomen," Jason said, placing the crown firmly, not at all gently, on Thomen's head.</p>
<a id="p6051" name="p6051"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6051)">Thomen eyed him for a long, long time. "You're not giving me much choice, are you?" he whispered.</p>
<a id="p6052" name="p6052"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6052)">"No, I'm not giving you <i>any </i>choice." Jason walked to the foot of the table and stood there for a moment, looking from face to face, fully ready and willing to kill anybody who objected. "Don't fuck with him, people. It wouldn't be a good idea."</p>
<a id="p6053" name="p6053"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6053)">But there were no objections.</p>
<a id="p6054" name="p6054"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6054)">It was time to go; he turned and walked out of the grand hall, Slovotsky and the dwarf beside him.</p>
<a id="p6055" name="p6055"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6055)">He paused at the door to shake hands with Durine, Kethol and Pirojil. "See you out at the castle," he said. "And don't get into any fights."</p>
<a id="p6056" name="p6056"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6056)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p6057" name="p6057"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6057)">Tennetty was waiting next to Ellegon in the courtyard, leaning against the dragon's bulk, her arms crossed.</p>
<a id="p6058" name="p6058"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6058)">Ellegon's wings furled and unfurled. *How does it feel not to be Heir anymore? Just a common baron.*</p>
<a id="p6059" name="p6059"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6059)">Jason laughed. "Hey, I'm used to having a title. Can't give it up all at once. &#151;Let's get out of here."</p>
<a id="p6060" name="p6060"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6060)">"You're not going without me," Tennetty said.</p>
<a id="p6061" name="p6061"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6061)">"Of course not," Ahira said.</p>
<a id="p6062" name="p6062"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6062)">"Wouldn't think of it," Jason said.</p>
<a id="p6063" name="p6063"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6063)">Slovotsky chuckled. "I wouldn't want to be the one to stop you."</p>
<a id="p6064" name="p6064"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6064)">She smiled. "I haven't heard any invitation."</p>
<a id="p6065" name="p6065"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6065)">Jason shrugged. "Well, what would you say to coming along with us? We've got to settle Walter's family into Castle Fu&#151;Castle Cullinane, that is, and then we've got some things to do."</p>
<a id="p6066" name="p6066"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6066)">*I heard something about changing the world.*</p>
<a id="p6067" name="p6067"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6067)"><i>Bet your scaly ass on it.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p6068" name="p6068"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6068)">She nodded, and hitched at her belt. "What would I say?" There must have been some dust in the air, or something. She rubbed at her eye. "I'd say that the Warrior lives."</p>
<a id="p6069" name="p6069"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(6069)">&nbsp;</p>
