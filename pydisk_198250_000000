<P align=CENTER>        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You could be `in harm's way'," I said to Carol, well  aware 
        that  the High Priestess doubtlessly "knew" by now that I  killed 
        her agent when I found him sabotaging the Diana.  If the  Priest-
        ess  decided to take "matters in hand" herself I didn't  want  to 
        think of the sort of dangers that I might be exposing Carol to...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  have no desire to be a `widow' either," Carol  answered, 
        gently patting the great beast that Maris had given us for  "pro-
        tection".  The gigantic dire wolf as big as a shetland pony  sit-
        ting  there,  its head on a level with Carol's shoulders  as  she 
        stood beside it.  It had been a "gift" from Queen Valeris to  the 
        Queen  of Dularn, who had quickly found that such an  animal  was 
        not  to be completely "trusted" on crowded teeming city  streets.  
        Kathi quietly regarding the crossbow that I had armed her with.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "These may give us an `edge'," I said, checking the brace of 
        flintlock pistols that we'd keep on the two bedstands.  If Martis 
        came  after  us herself, she was not likely to be  following  the 
        "weapon laws".  What "sort" of weapons the Priestesses of Lys had 
        was  something I didn't know, but I could assume that they  would 
        at least possess the most advanced weapons of the 21st Century!!!
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The "attack snarl" of a mutated seven hundred pound Canadian 
        dire  wolf is something I hope to never hear again as I was  sud-
        denly woke from a fitful sleep by the great beast's sudden attack 
        upon the white gowned figure now standing there in our bedroom!!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             There  was a dazzling bright flash of a blue-white  beam  of 
        light  as the Priestess raised her right arm, the  gigantic  wolf 
        for an instant seeming to "glow" as she jumped to one side of it!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Die!"  the High Priestess screamed, a beam of bright  blue-
        white light sizzling just over us to strike the wall, the  flint-
        lock pistol in Carol's hand deafening as she fired over my shoul-
        der!  A smell in the room like that of some great electric  storm 
        as  High Priestess Martis fired an uncontrolled shot up into  the 
        ceiling over our heads!  The "buck" of the pistol in my hand  un-
        noticed as I fired, dropping her then and putting an end to this!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Fire!"  Kathi cried, the smoke and flames now visible  from 
        the effects of the Priestess' weapon, some sort of "laser" I sus-
        pected, although nothing like anything I'd ever seen before now!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Put it out!" Carol snapped, jumping from the bed, her sword 
        in her hand, running to the still form of the Priestess while our 
        slave girl and I bent our efforts at beating out the two fires...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She's dead," I said, holding the lamp, Carol now  squatting 
        down,  removing the silvery tube like device from  Martis'  hand.  
        It was little larger than a "pocket flashlight" from our own era, 
        although its "deadliness" was obvious from the still form of  the 
        wolf who had died attempting to protect us.  The cause of death I 
        quickly determined to be most likely electrocution, such  weapons 
        "killing"  in much the same way as a lightning bolt does, I  sus-
        pect.   The  "power supply" is quite "limited",  and  the  weapon 
        really  is not as "effective" as say a Lorr blaster pistol  might 
        be.   It is not very "accurate" as you have seen from this  story 
        both from its design and the lack of any sort of a "sighting sys-
        tem".  On the other hand it certainly doesn't lack for  "stopping 
        power" as it "dropped" our Canadian mutated dire wolf instantly.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You killed a `Priestess'...," Kathi "muttered", looking on.  
        There  was blood on the white gown, and a hole in  her  forehead.  
        Carol's  shot had hit her in the chest, mine there in  the  head.  
        The back of the head was a blasted bloody mass of bone and brain.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "An evil woman, who `betrayed' her vows," Carol answered.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Kathi,  go to Queen Maris, bring her here," I ordered  her.  
        The slave girl nodding, shivering in terror as she scampered off.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "How  did she get in?" Carol said to me, Kathi dashing  down 
        the stairs towards the street, almost as if driven by demons now!  
        The  front door had been locked, and there was no other way  into 
        our home, or was there now?  I glanced "up", my wife now nodding!
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I've  heard of `these'," I said, looking at the "flyer",  a 
        device that muchly resembled a "wet bike" of the 20th Century  in 
        some ways.  The question was how to get "rid" of the damm thing!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Bob!  You Don't Know How!" Carol protested as I "straddled" 
        it!  It was a moonless night, the sky overcast.  No doubt  Martis 
        had  flown it over the city from the Temple to here,  landing  on 
        our roof!  That explained too how she'd managed to gain entrance!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They're just women with an `advanced technology'," I  said, 
        studying the flyer's controls there in the light of Carol's lamp.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Ohh," Carol gasped, the flyer floating up a bit just then!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Think  I've got the `hang' of it," I smiled,  twisting  the 
        control, the rooftop dropping away there beneath me!  I'm not too 
        bothered by "heights", but this wasn't the most enjoyable "ride"!  
        Arsana spreading out there beneath me as I rose up into the sky!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             It  was a "hairy" thing to "ride", especially if you  really 
        didn't  know what you were doing.  The right twist grip acted  as 
        an "accelerator", the left controlled "up and down", while  push-
        ing the "handlebars" controlled direction.  Just what the flyer's 
        "range" was I didn't know, although I didn't think it was  likely 
        to be too far, the craft obviously controlling gravity some way!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I swung it around towards the harbor, the lights of the city 
        there below, well aware of the instant death that awaited me if I 
        did  the  least thing wrong now!  I needed to get  "rid"  of  the 
        flyer,  but HOW?  I could land outside the city, leave it, but  I 
        wanted to get rid of it in a way that couldn't be traced back...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Wrap  up the body in several blankets," the  Queen  ordered 
        standing  there in our bedroom, a hooded cloak thrown  over  her-
        self.  Carol did so without a word while Kathi whimpered to  her-
        self in terror at the very idea of what might happen to them  all 
        if  the Priestesses of Lys found out that we had just killed  one 
        of their number.  There is an automatic death penalty for killing 
        a Priestess, although I didn't think that it would have been "en-
        forced" in this case as the High Priestess of Dularn had obvious-
        ly come to us with murder in her heart and our deaths in mind...!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "How are we going to dispose of it?" Carol asked Maris Marn.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The  Diana's boilers are large enough to hold a body,"  the 
        Queen answered.  "And a coal fire is hot enough to destroy it."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You have a carriage?" Carol asked.  Maris nodding, smiling.  
        Her captain of guards, Tori Wells, she trusted to keep "secrets"!
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There  are certain `advantages' to being a `Queen',"  Maris 
        said to me as I carried the blanket wrapped body aboard the ship.  
        Maris' "authority" being such that no one asked her  "questions".  
        Captain Wells in her chain mail watching us all silently.  I  was 
        dripping  wet now from my swim back to the Diana  after  crashing 
        the flyer into the water.  Thankfully it had sunk as I had hoped!  
        Due to the darkness of the night I doubted anyone saw anything...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Hope  someone doesn't wonder why we're getting up steam  in 
        the middle of the night," Carol said, closing the hatch behind us 
        and  dogging it shut.  The interior of the Diana pitch  dark  but 
        for the starlight streaming down through the overhead hatches.  I 
        was thankful for Maris' lamp, although I know the Diana by heart.  
        Tori's eyes gleaming into mine for an instant as I glanced  back.  
        She was a sexy looking woman, almost another "Carol" in looks...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  doubt that she told anyone what she was  `planning',"  I 
        answered.   This had been no doubt a "solo operation"  given  the 
        actual nature of what the High Priestess had attempted to "do"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Let us `hope' so," the Queen of Dularn "smiled" in reply.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Boiler room one," I said, Maris lifting up her lamp.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That should be enough coal," I said, setting down the shov-
        el.  I lifted the blanket wrapped body, pushed it in through  the 
        door,  laying it out on the coal, and then closed the door  after 
        tossing in a match to light the lamp oil soaked coal.  A few more 
        strokes of the pump sent enough lamp oil into the boiler to get a 
        good fire going, Carol peeking in through the little port in  the 
        door to see how well the fire was burning up the Priestess' body.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Be  careful with that," Maris warned as I once  again  took 
        out  the Priestess' weapon she'd given me and studied it.  I  had 
        already determined what was the "trigger" and what was the "safe-
        ty"  on it.  I debated whether to keep it or not.  I had no  idea 
        of  how to "recharge" it, and was doubtful that it could be  done 
        in any case...  It really didn't seem too wise to keep it around.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Throw it away, Bob, Get Rid Of It!" Carol then warned me.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I  walked down to the end of the dock alongside  the  Diana, 
        the  smoke pouring from the funnel tower at the stern, rising  up 
        into  the  star sprinkled sky above, the lights of the  city  re-
        flected  in the rippling waters of the bay, and flung the  weapon 
        as far out into the bay as I could.  For a few seconds I  thought 
        that would be the "end" of it, then suddenly there was a  "flash" 
        in the water and a "whoom" as water flew up as from an explosion!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Lousy  engineering," I smiled to myself, seeing  the  water 
        now settle back.  "What you'd expect from some bunch of `women'!"  
        It  being rather "obvious" that the Priestesses weren't all  that 
        great as "engineers" despite their "technological  advantages"...  
        Fortunately the flyer had been somewhat better designed that way!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The  Priestesses  of Lys have `reported'  that  their  High 
        Priestess  is `missing' and they fear `foul play' has  occurred," 
        the Queen of Dularn said to me the next afternoon as Jard  Sandar 
        and I were going over the Diana inch by inch just to "check" what 
        sort of sabotage had been done to the ship at Martis' orders.   I 
        had not told him, of course, that her ashes were now at the  bot-
        tom  of the bay after being "dumped" from boiler number  one.   I 
        was well aware that a number of the Priestesses had  "telepathic" 
        powers to a certain extent, but as neither Carol or I were  "tem-
        ple goers" as such, I wasn't too worried about "that" right  now.  
        Maris wasn't either, although I wasn't too sure about Tori  here.  
        She was a married woman, her husband a Physician, with  children.  
        Maris said she was "trustworthy" even in a "matter" such as this!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We used to have the same sort of `problems' in the  Twenti-
        eth Century," I answered, giving the Queen a big "grin" and  see-
        ing her "nod" in reply.  "They used to pass an additional  `anti-
        gun law' after such `incidents' but I guess you can't do that  as 
        `guns' don't exist in this time."  Jard looking at me curiously.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "A  search will be made of the city, but I do not expect  to 
        `find' anything," Maris Marn smiled back, well aware that she was 
        as  "involved" in all this as we were.  Kathi was utterly  terri-
        fied of what could happen to us, but I wasn't too concerned now.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There's someone coming up the steps!" Carol breathed as  we 
        ate dinner that evening there on the roof of our house, a  golden 
        head and azure eyes suddenly popping up as Tais climbed up to the 
        roof, the breeze from the strait gently ruffling her hair a  bit.  
        The  rays of the sun low in the west sending sparkling  beams  of 
        light from her diamond encrusted ankh there between her breasts.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You probably `know all'," I told the Priestess, aware  that 
        Tais  had  the power to read our thoughts.  The  First  Priestess 
        smiling  back.  I was well aware that the house had  been  locked 
        from  below, but I supposed that wouldn't have been  a  "problem" 
        for  Tais any more than it had been for Martis the night  before!  
        Kathi cringing down like a whipped cur, shaking with open terror!  
        The  slave girl suddenly then actually wetting the  roof  beneath 
        her as she voided urine in her terror like I've seen animals do.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You saved us the `trouble' of a trial and execution,"  Tais 
        answered.   "And perhaps a great deal more had it become  `known' 
        that one of us had `misused' her powers for the service of evil."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Couldn't  you `detect' such with your  telepathic  powers?" 
        Carol asked, motioning for Kathi to set a place for Tais to  sit.  
        The First Priestess drawing up a chair, and then seating herself.  
        Kathi then dashing off to wash herself and put on a clean strap.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I did not believe that she would break her  `programming'," 
        Tais answered.  "It hasn't ever `happened' before," she added.  I 
        had suspected "such" was the case, knowing what I did about them.  
        I supposed it had come as a great "shock" to the Priestesses that 
        one of their number could actually attempt to commit a "murder"!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Maybe  I'm `trespassing' where I don't `belong',  but  have 
        you  ever considered the `fact' that this `war between  good  and 
        evil' that you told us about could perhaps be `stopped' before it 
        ever  happens?" I challenged, Tais' azure eyes blazing into  mine 
        as she sat there with a piece of meat on her fork halfway to  her 
        mouth.   "That perhaps a small force could be sent  forward  into 
        time to put a `stop' to it before it ever happens?" I added then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It could be a `suicide mission'," Tais answered me softly.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Are  you familiar with the caste codes of the Warriors?"  I 
        asked the First Priestess.  Such "things" are spoken of in  them.  
        I glanced at Carol, at her swollen belly, at the life within her.  
        I thought of a certain "blonde" I knew, brave beyond all  others, 
        who might be just the "sword companion" for such an  "adventure".  
        I am a proficient rifleman, fairly "good" with a handgun too...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Bob!  You could get killed!" Carol protested then as I  had 
        suspected that she would.  I had no doubts that was possible too!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There are things worth dying for," I said, seeing her  nod.  
        "And I want my daughter to live in a world safe from danger..."
