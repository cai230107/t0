<h2 class="chapter">80</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; Swan murmured when I stepped out where
he could see me. &ldquo;No wonder you went back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands off, pretty boy. Ay, Nyueng Bao! If you are out
there go see Tarn Dak. It&rsquo;s important. Taglians. See Rudy from
the Company.&rdquo; I turned back to Swan. &ldquo;There.
We&rsquo;re down to a few snipers. Just in case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped staring at Sahra. &ldquo;Sorry. You really stumbled
into the sweet shit, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He did have the
courtesy to make his remarks in Forsberger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I did. What&rsquo;s going on? I wake up the other
day, after my wizards did an experiment on me, and I find out that
somebody has been inside my head, messing with my memories. I find
out I&rsquo;m back over there in hell&rsquo;s kitchen hunting rats
and fighting cannibals when all the time my so-called friends are
sitting around out here not even letting me know the Shadowmaster
is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swan gave me a dumb look.
&ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You knew that, Murgen. You was
over here when we killed the bastard. You was here for a week after
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killed him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It began to dawn. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t insist on going back?
She said you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t. When I found myself headed that way I
thought I was escaping from Shadowspinner. I really believed that I
hadn&rsquo;t gotten to you people. I think.&rdquo; It got more
confused as I tried to figure it out.</p>

<p>Somebody called out something in Nyueng Bao. My troops had not
followed orders. Someone else, in Taglian, called, &ldquo;Can you
come up here please, Mr. Murgen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told Swan, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up. You
better stand fast. These guys are real touchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got nothing else to do with my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean it. They&rsquo;re paranoid in a big way. If you
had spent the last several months in there you&rsquo;d
understand,&rdquo; I clambered up a steep slope to where one
Taglian knelt in some scraggly brush with a Nyueng Bao about
fifteen years old.</p>

<p>The boy pointed, eager to be the first to deliver bad news.</p>

<p>Fresh smoke rose from Dejagore. From, near as I could tell, the
north barbican. It looked like there was fighting there.</p>

<p>A mauve flash told me One-Eye or Goblin was involved.</p>

<p>Mogaba must be trying to recover the barbican.</p>

<p>I spied flickers around the west gate, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damned Mogaba. Thanks, guys. Nothing we can do about it,
though.&rdquo; I hoped One-Eye and Goblin carved Mogaba a new poop
chute. &ldquo;Get on back to camp, will you? There&rsquo;s stuff
that&rsquo;s got to get done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady was gone. Blade was in charge and just sitting around
collecting refugees from the city, keeping them from reporting back
with news about Shadowspinner. He admitted that.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she wants done.&rdquo; He seemed
indifferent to Sahra, unlike every other man in camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lucky she&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; I
grumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d turn her over my knee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since there was nothing else going on I sat around with him and
Swan and Mather until it started to get dark. Somebody found a
puppy for To Tan to play with. When it got late I said,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get back to our people. They&rsquo;ll be
getting nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No can do, buddy,&rdquo; Mather told me.</p>

<p>Blade agreed. &ldquo;She said no exceptions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warmth went out of the air. I gave each one what I thought
of as the Nyueng Bao look. Swan and Mather averted their eyes.
Blade took it but with a twitch.</p>

<p>Sahra seemed untroubled. I suppose, after Dejagore, it was hard
to imagine a turn for the worse. She even smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assume the prison pen is where I left it?&rdquo; I
remembered that part of my previous visit perfectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will keep you more comfortably,&rdquo; Blade
promised.</p>

<p>Mather volunteered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you where to
bunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were far enough away not to overhear, Swan thought. He told
Blade, &ldquo;You look at her good? That&rsquo;s one spooky
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at Sahra. I assumed she heard, too, but her expression
told me nothing.</p>

<p>If Blade answered Swan he spoke more softly.</p>

<p>I continued to study Sahra, wondering what Swan had seen.</p>
