<h2 class="chapter">SANSA</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he invitation seemed innocent enough, but every time Sansa read
it her tummy tightened into a knot. <em>She&rsquo;s to be queen now,
she&rsquo;s beautiful and rich and everyone loves her, why would
she want to sup with a traitor&rsquo;s daughter?</em> It could be
curiosity, she supposed; perhaps Margaery Tyrell wanted to get the
measure of the rival she&rsquo;d displaced. <em>Does she resent me, I
wonder? Does she think I bear her ill
will</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sansa had watched from the castle walls as Margaery Tyrell and
her escort made their way up Aegon&rsquo;s High Hill. Joffrey had
met his new bride-to-be at the King&rsquo;s Gate to welcome her to
the city, and they rode side by side through cheering crowds, Joff
glittering in gilded armor and the Tyrell girl splendid in green
with a cloak of autumn flowers blowing from her shoulders. She was
sixteen, brown-haired and brown-eyed, slender and beautiful. The
people called out her name as she passed, held up their children
for her blessing, and scattered flowers under the hooves of her
horse. Her mother and grandmother followed close behind, riding in
a tall wheelhouse whose sides were carved into the shape of a
hundred twining roses, every one gilded and shining. The smallfolk
cheered them as well.</p>

<p><em>The same smallfolk who pulled me from my horse and would have
killed me, if not for the Hound</em>. Sansa had done nothing to make the
commons hate her, no more than Margaery Tyrell had done to win
their love. <em>Does she want me to love her too?</em> She studied the
invitation, which looked to be written in Margaery&rsquo;s own
hand. <em>Does she want my blessing?</em> Sansa wondered if Joffrey knew of
this supper. For all she knew, it might be his doing. That thought
made her fearful. If Joff was behind the invitation, he would have
some cruel jape planned to shame her in the older girl&rsquo;s
eyes. Would he command his Kingsguard to strip her naked once
again? The last time he had done that his uncle Tyrion had stopped
him, but the Imp could not save her now.</p>

<p><em>No one can save me but my Florian</em>. Ser Dontos had promised he
would help her escape, but not until the night of Joffrey&rsquo;s
wedding. The plans had been well laid, her dear devoted
knight-turned-fool assured her; there was nothing to do until then
but endure, and count the days.</p>

<p><em>And sup with my replacement</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps she was doing Margaery Tyrell an injustice. Perhaps the
invitation was no more than a simple kindness, an act of courtesy.
<em>It might be just a supper</em>. But this was the Red Keep, this was
King&rsquo;s Landing, this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon,
the First of His Name, and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark
had learned here, it was mistrust.</p>

<p>Even so, she must accept. She was nothing now, the discarded
daughter of a traitor and disgraced sister of a rebel lord. She
could scarcely refuse Joffrey&rsquo;s queen-to-be.</p>

<p><em>I wish the Hound were here</em>. The night of the battle, Sandor
Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but
Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if
she&rsquo;d been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a
cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why
she&rsquo;d kept it. The Hound had turned craven, she heard it
said; at the height of the battle, he got so drunk the Imp had to
take his men. But Sansa understood. She knew the secret of his
burned face. <em>It was only the fire he feared</em>. That night, the
wildfire had set the river itself ablaze, and filled the very air
with green flame. Even in the castle, Sansa had been afraid.
Outside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she could scarcely imagine
it.</p>

<p>Sighing, she got out quill and ink, and wrote Margaery Tyrell a
gracious note of acceptance.</p>

<p>When the appointed night arrived, another of the Kingsguard came
for her, a man as different from Sandor Clegane
as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>well, as a flower from a dog</em>. The sight
of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on her threshold made Sansa&rsquo;s
heart beat a little faster. This was the first time she had been so
close to him since he had returned to King&rsquo;s Landing, leading
the vanguard of his father&rsquo;s host. For a moment she did not
know what to say. &ldquo;Ser Loras,&rdquo; she finally managed,
&ldquo;you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you look so lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her a puzzled smile. &ldquo;My lady is too kind. And
beautiful besides. My sister awaits you eagerly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have so looked forward to our supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As has Margaery, and my lady grandmother as well.&rdquo;
He took her arm and led her toward the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother?&rdquo; Sansa was finding it hard to
walk and talk and think all at the same time, with Ser Loras
touching her arm. She could feel the warmth of his hand through the
silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Olenna. She is to sup with you as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sansa. <em>I am talking to him, and
he&rsquo;s touching me, he&rsquo;s holding my arm and touching me</em>.
&ldquo;The Queen of Thorns, she&rsquo;s called. Isn&rsquo;t that
right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Ser Loras laughed. <em>He has the warmest
laugh</em>, she thought as he went on, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best not use
that name in her presence, though, or you&rsquo;re like to get
pricked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa reddened. Any fool would have realized that no woman would
be happy about being called &ldquo;the Queen of Thorns.&rdquo;
<em>Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says</em>. Desperately
she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him,
but her wits had deserted her. She almost told him how beautiful he
was, until she remembered that she&rsquo;d already done that.</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> beautiful, though. He seemed taller than he&rsquo;d been
when she&rsquo;d first met him, but still so lithe and graceful,
and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes.
<em>He&rsquo;s no boy, though, he&rsquo;s a man grown, a knight of the
Kingsguard</em>. She thought he looked even finer in white than in the
greens and golds of House Tyrell. The only spot of color on him now
was the brooch that clasped his cloak; the rose of Highgarden
wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green
jade leaves.</p>

<p>Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor&rsquo;s for them to
pass. He was all in white as well, though he did not wear it half
so well as Ser Loras. Beyond the spiked moat, two dozen men were
taking their practice with sword and shield. With the castle so
crowded, the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise
their tents and pavilions, leaving only the smaller inner yards for
training. One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser
Tallad, with the eyes on his shield. Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce,
who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword, seemed
to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack, but Osney&rsquo;s
brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire
Morros Slynt. Blunted swords or no, Slynt would have a rich crop of
bruises by the morrow. It made Sansa wince just to watch. <em>They have
scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle, and
already they are practicing for the next one</em>.</p>

<p>On the edge of the yard, a lone knight with a pair of golden
roses on his shield was holding off three foes. Even as they
watched, he caught one of them alongside the head, knocking him
senseless. &ldquo;Is that your brother?&rdquo; Sansa asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, my lady,&rdquo; said Ser Loras. &ldquo;Garlan
often trains against three men, or even four. In battle it is
seldom one against one, he says, so he likes to be
prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be very brave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a great knight,&rdquo; Ser Loras replied. &ldquo;A
better sword than me, in truth, though I&rsquo;m the better
lance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Sansa. &ldquo;You ride
wonderfully, ser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady is gracious to say so. When has she seen me
ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Hand&rsquo;s tourney, don&rsquo;t you remember?
You rode a white courser, and your armor was a hundred different
kinds of flowers. You gave me a rose. A <em>red</em> rose. You threw white
roses to the other girls that day.&rdquo; It made her flush to
speak of it. &ldquo;You said no victory was half as beautiful as
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Loras gave her a modest smile. &ldquo;I spoke only a simple
truth, that any man with eyes could see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He doesn&rsquo;t remember</em>, Sansa realized, startled. <em>He is only
being kind to me, he doesn&rsquo;t remember me or the rose or any
of it</em>. She had been so certain that it meant something, that it
meant <em>everything</em>. A <em>red</em> rose, not a white. &ldquo;It was after you
unhorsed Ser Robar Royce,&rdquo; she said, desperately.</p>

<p>He took his hand from her arm. &ldquo;I slew Robar at
Storm&rsquo;s End, my lady.&rdquo; It was not a boast; he sounded
sad.</p>

<p><em>Him, and another of King Renly&rsquo;s Rainbow Guard as well,
yes</em>. Sansa had heard the women talking of it round the well, but
for a moment she&rsquo;d forgotten. &ldquo;That was when Lord Renly
was killed, wasn&rsquo;t it? How terrible for your poor
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Margaery?&rdquo; His voice was tight. &ldquo;To be
sure. She was at Bitterbridge, though. She did not see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, when she
heard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Loras brushed the hilt of his sword lightly with his hand.
Its grip was white leather, its pommel a rose in alabaster.
&ldquo;Renly is dead. Robar as well. What use to speak of
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sharpness in his tone took her aback.
&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my lord,
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I did not mean to give offense,
ser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor could you, Lady Sansa,&rdquo; Ser Loras replied, but
all the warmth had gone from his voice. Nor did he take her arm
again.</p>

<p>They ascended the serpentine steps in a deepening silence.</p>

<p><em>Oh, why did I have to mention Ser Robar?</em> Sansa thought.
<em>I&rsquo;ve ruined everything. He is angry with me now</em>. She tried to
think of something she might say to make amends, but all the words
that came to her were lame and weak. <em>Be quiet, or you will only
make it worse</em>, she told herself.</p>

<p>Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage had been housed behind the
royal sept, in the long slate-roofed keep that had been called the
Maidenvault since King Baelor the Blessed had confined his sisters
therein, so the sight of them might not tempt him into carnal
thoughts. Outside its tall carved doors stood two guards in gilded
halfhelms and green cloaks edged in gold satin, the golden rose of
Highgarden sewn on their breasts. Both were seven-footers, wide of
shoulder and narrow of waist, magnificently muscled. When Sansa got
close enough to see their faces, she could not tell one from the
other. They had the same strong jaws, the same deep blue eyes, the
same thick red mustaches. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; she asked Ser
Loras, her discomfit forgotten for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandmother&rsquo;s personal guard,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;Their mother named them Erryk and Arryk, but
Grandmother can&rsquo;t tell them apart, so she calls them Left and
Right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left and Right opened the doors, and Margaery Tyrell herself
emerged and swept down the short flight of steps to greet them.
&ldquo;Lady Sansa,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased
you came. Be welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa knelt at the feet of her future queen. &ldquo;You do me
great honor, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you call me Margaery? Please, rise. Loras,
help the Lady Sansa to her feet. Might I call you Sansa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it please you.&rdquo; Ser Loras helped her up.</p>

<p>Margaery dismissed him with a sisterly kiss, and took Sansa by
the hand. &ldquo;Come, my grandmother awaits, and she is not the
most patient of ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fire was crackling in the hearth, and sweet-swelling rushes
had been scattered on the floor. Around the long trestle table a
dozen women were seated.</p>

<p>Sansa recognized only Lord Tyrell&rsquo;s tall, dignified wife,
Lady Alerie, whose long silvery braid was bound with jeweled rings.
Margaery performed the other introductions. There were three Tyrell
cousins, Megga and Alla and Elinor, all close to Sansa&rsquo;s age.
Buxom Lady Janna was Lord Tyrell&rsquo;s sister, and wed to one of
the green-apple Fossoways; dainty, bright-eyed Lady Leonette was a
Fossoway as well, and wed to Ser Garlan. Septa Nysterica had a
homely pox-scarred face but seemed jolly. Pale, elegant Lady
Graceford was with child, and Lady Bulwer was a child, no more than
eight. And &ldquo;Merry&rdquo; was what she was to call boisterous
plump Meredyth Crane, but most definitely <em>not</em> Lady Merryweather, a
sultry black-eyed Myrish beauty.</p>

<p>Last of all, Margaery brought her before the wizened
white-haired doll of a woman at the head of the table. &ldquo;I am
honored to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna, widow to the
late Luthor Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden, whose memory is a comfort
to us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman smelled of rosewater. <em>Why, she&rsquo;s just the
littlest bit of a thing</em>. There was nothing the least bit thorny
about her. &ldquo;Kiss me, child,&rdquo; Lady Olenna said, tugging
at Sansa&rsquo;s wrist with a soft spotted hand. &ldquo;It is so
kind of you to sup with me and my foolish flock of hens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dutifully, Sansa kissed the old woman on the cheek. &ldquo;It is
kind of you to have me, my lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew your grandfather, Lord Rickard, though not
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died before I was born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of that, child. It&rsquo;s said that your
Tully grandfather is dying too. Lord Hoster, surely they told you?
An old man, though not so old as me. Still, night falls for all of
us in the end, and too soon for some. You would know that more than
most, poor child. You&rsquo;ve had your share of grief, I know. We
are sorry for your losses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa glanced at Margaery. &ldquo;I was saddened when I heard of
Lord Renly&rsquo;s death, Your Grace. He was very
gallant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are kind to say so,&rdquo; answered Margaery.</p>

<p>Her grandmother snorted. &ldquo;Gallant, yes, and charming, and
very clean. He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he
knew how to bathe, and somehow he got the notion that this made him
fit to be king. The Baratheons have always had some queer notions,
to be sure. It comes from their Targaryen blood, I should
think.&rdquo; She sniffed. &ldquo;They tried to marry me to a
Targaryen once, but I soon put an end to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother,&rdquo; said
Margaery. &ldquo;Father liked him as well, and so did
Loras.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loras is young,&rdquo; Lady Olenna said crisply,
&ldquo;and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That
does not make him wise. As to your father, would that I&rsquo;d been born
a peasant woman with a big wooden spoon, I might have been able to
beat some sense into his fat head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mother</em>,&rdquo; Lady Alerie scolded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Alerie, don&rsquo;t take that tone with me. And
don&rsquo;t call me Mother. If I&rsquo;d given birth to you,
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d remember. I&rsquo;m only to blame for your
husband, the lord oaf of Highgarden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; Margaery said, &ldquo;mind your
words, or what will Sansa think of us? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at
any rate.&rdquo; The old woman turned back to Sansa.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s treason, I warned them, Robert has two sons, and
Renly has an older brother, how can he <em>possibly</em> have any claim to
that ugly iron chair? Tut-tut, says my son, don&rsquo;t you want
your sweetling to be queen? You Starks were kings once, the Arryns
and the Lannisters as well, and even the Baratheons through the
female line, but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until Aegon
the Dragon came along and cooked the rightful King of the Reach on
the Field of Fire. If truth be told, even our claim to Highgarden
is a bit dodgy, just as those dreadful Florents are always whining.
&lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; you ask, and of course it
doesn&rsquo;t, except to oafs like my son. The thought that one day
he may see his grandson with his arse on the Iron Throne makes Mace puff up like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;now, what do you
call it? Margaery, you&rsquo;re clever, be a dear and tell your
poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the
Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call them puff fish, Grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they do. Summer Islanders have no imagination.
My son ought to take the puff fish for his sigil, if truth be told.
He could put a crown on it, the way the Baratheons do their stag,
mayhap that would make him happy. We should have stayed well out of
all this bloody foolishness if you ask me, but once the cow&rsquo;s
been milked there&rsquo;s no squirting the cream back up her udder.
After Lord Puff Fish put that crown on Renly&rsquo;s head, we were
into the pudding up to our knees, so here we are to see things
through. And what do you say to that, Sansa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa&rsquo;s mouth opened and closed. She felt very like a puff
fish herself. &ldquo;The Tyrells can trace their descent back to
Garth Greenhand,&rdquo; was the best she could manage at short
notice.</p>

<p>The Queen of Thorns snorted. &ldquo;So can the Florents, the
Rowans, the Oakhearts, and half the other noble houses of the
south. Garth liked to plant his seed in fertile ground, they say. I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder that more than his hands were
green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sansa</em>,&rdquo; Lady Alerie broke in, &ldquo;you must be
very hungry. Shall we have a bite of boar together, and some lemon
cakes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemon cakes are my favorite,&rdquo; Sansa admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we have been told,&rdquo; declared Lady Olenna, who
obviously had no intention of being hushed. &ldquo;That Varys
creature seemed to think we should be grateful for the information.
I&rsquo;ve never been quite sure what the <em>point</em> of a eunuch is, if
truth be told. It seems to me they&rsquo;re only men with the
useful bits cut off. Alerie, will you have them bring the food, or
do you mean to starve me to death? Here, Sansa, sit here next to
me, I&rsquo;m much less boring than these others. I hope that
you&rsquo;re fond of fools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa smoothed down her skirts and sat. &ldquo;I
think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fools, my lady? You
mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the sort in motley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feathers, in this case. What did you imagine I was
speaking of? My son? Or these lovely ladies? No, don&rsquo;t blush,
with your hair it makes you look like a pomegranate. All men are
fools, if truth be told, but the ones in motley are more amusing
than ones with crowns. Margaery, child, summon Butterbumps, let us
see if we can&rsquo;t make Lady Sansa smile. The rest of you be
seated, do I have to tell you everything? Sansa must think that my
granddaughter is attended by a flock of sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Butterbumps arrived before the food, dressed in a jester&rsquo;s
suit of green and yellow feathers with a floppy coxcomb. An immense
round fat man, as big as three Moon Boys, he came cartwheeling into
the hall, vaulted onto the table, and laid a gigantic egg right in
front of Sansa. &ldquo;Break it, my lady,&rdquo; he commanded. When
she did, a dozen yellow chicks escaped and began running in all
directions. &ldquo;<em>Catch them!</em>&rdquo; Butterbumps exclaimed. Little
Lady Bulwer snagged one and handed it to him, whereby he tilted
back his head, popped it into his huge rubbery mouth, and seemed to
swallow it whole. When he belched, tiny yellow feathers flew out
his nose. Lady Bulwer began to wail in distress, but her tears
turned into a sudden squeal of delight when the chick came
squirming out of the sleeve of her gown and ran down her arm.</p>

<p>As the servants brought out a broth of leeks and mushrooms,
Butterbumps began to juggle and Lady Olenna pushed herself forward
to rest her elbows on the table. &ldquo;Do you know my son, Sansa?
Lord Puff Fish of Highgarden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great lord,&rdquo; Sansa answered politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great oaf,&rdquo; said the Queen of Thorns. &ldquo;His
father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. Oh, I
loved him well enough, don&rsquo;t mistake me. A kind man, and not
unskilled in the bedchamber, but an appalling oaf all the same. He
managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking
up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now my oaf son is doing the same, only he&rsquo;s
riding a lion instead of a palfrey. It is easy to mount a lion and
not so easy to get off, I warned him, but he only chuckles. Should
you ever have a son, Sansa, beat him frequently so he learns to
mind you. I only had the one boy and I hardly beat him at all, so
now he pays more heed to Butterbumps than he does to me. A lion is
not a lap cat, I told him, and he gives me a
&lsquo;tut-tut-Mother.&rsquo; There is entirely too much tut-tutting
in this realm, if you ask me. All these kings would do a deal
better if they would put down their swords and listen to their
mothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa realized that her mouth was open again. She filled it with
a spoon of broth while Lady Alerie and the other women were
giggling at the spectacle of Butterbumps bouncing oranges off his
head, his elbows, and his ample rump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me the truth about this royal
boy,&rdquo; said Lady Olenna abruptly. &ldquo;This
Joffrey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa&rsquo;s fingers tightened round her spoon. <em>The truth? I
can&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t ask it, please, I can&rsquo;t</em>.
&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, yes. Who would know better? The lad seems kingly
enough, I&rsquo;ll grant you. A bit full of himself, but that would
be his Lannister blood. We have heard some troubling tales,
however. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa glanced about nervously. Butterbumps popped a whole orange
into his mouth, chewed and swallowed, slapped his cheek, and blew
seeds out of his nose. The women giggled and laughed. Servants were
coming and going, and the Maidenvault echoed to the clatter of
spoons and plates. One of the chicks hopped back onto the table and
ran through Lady Graceford&rsquo;s broth. No one seemed to be
paying them any mind, but even so, she was frightened.</p>

<p>Lady Olenna was growing impatient. &ldquo;Why are you gaping at
Butterbumps? I asked a question, I expect an answer. Have the
Lannisters stolen your tongue, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Dontos had warned her to speak freely only in the godswood.
&ldquo;Joff&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;King Joffrey,
he&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;His Grace is very fair and
handsome, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and as brave as a
lion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the Lannisters are lions, and when a Tyrell
breaks wind it smells just like a rose,&rdquo; the old woman
snapped. &ldquo;But how <em>kind</em> is he? How clever? Has he a good
heart, a gentle hand? Is he chivalrous as befits a king? Will he
cherish Margaery and treat her tenderly, protect her honor as he
would his own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; Sansa lied. &ldquo;He is
very&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;very comely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said that. You know, child, some say that you are as
big a fool as Butterbumps here, and I am starting to believe them.
<em>Comely?</em> I have taught my Margaery what comely is worth, I hope.
Somewhat less than a mummer&rsquo;s fart. Aerion Brightfire was
comely enough, but a monster all the same. The question is, what is
Joffrey?&rdquo; She reached to snag a passing servant. &ldquo;I am
not fond of leeks. Take this broth away, and bring me some
cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cheese will be served after the cakes, my
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cheese will be served when I want it served, and I
want it served now.&rdquo; The old woman turned back to Sansa.
&ldquo;Are you frightened, child? No need for that, we&rsquo;re
only women here. Tell me the truth, no harm will come to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father always told the truth.&rdquo; Sansa spoke
quietly, but even so, it was hard to get the words out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Eddard, yes, he had that reputation, but they named
him traitor and took his head off even so.&rdquo; The old
woman&rsquo;s eyes bore into her, sharp and bright as the points of
swords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joffrey,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Joffrey did that. He
promised me he would be merciful, and cut my father&rsquo;s head
off. He said <em>that</em> was mercy, and he took me up on the walls and
made me look at it. The head. He wanted me to weep,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly, and
covered her mouth. <em>I&rsquo;ve said too much, oh gods be good,
they&rsquo;ll know, they&rsquo;ll hear, someone will tell on me</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; It was Margaery who urged. Joffrey&rsquo;s
own queen-to-be. Sansa did not know how much she had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; <em>What if she tells him, what if she
tells? He&rsquo;ll kill me for certain then, or give me to Ser
Ilyn</em>. &ldquo;I never meant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my father was
a traitor, my brother as well, I have the traitor&rsquo;s blood,
please, don&rsquo;t make me say more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, child,&rdquo; the Queen of Thorns
commanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s terrified, Grandmother, just look at
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman called to Butterbumps. &ldquo;<em>Fool!</em> Give us a
song. A long one, I should think. &lsquo;The Bear and the Maiden
Fair&rsquo; will do nicely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will!&rdquo; the huge jester replied. &ldquo;It will
do nicely indeed! Shall I sing it standing on my head, my
lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that make it sound better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand on your feet, then. We wouldn&rsquo;t want your hat
to fall off. As I recall, you never wash your hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my lady commands.&rdquo; Butterbumps bowed low, let
loose of an enormous belch, then straightened, threw out his belly,
and bellowed. &ldquo;<em>A bear there was, a bear, a BEAR! All black
and brown, and covered with
hair</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Olenna squirmed forward. &ldquo;Even when I was a girl
younger than you, it was well known that in the Red Keep the very
walls have ears. Well, they will be the better for a song, and
meanwhile we girls shall speak freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Sansa said,
&ldquo;Varys&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he <em>knows</em>, he
always&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sing louder!</em>&rdquo; the Queen of Thorns shouted at
Butterbumps. &ldquo;These old ears are almost deaf, you know. Are
you whispering at me, you fat fool? I don&rsquo;t pay you for
whispers. <em>Sing!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>THE BEAR!</em>&rdquo; thundered
Butterbumps, his great deep voice echoing off the rafters.
&ldquo;<em>OH, COME, THEY SAID, OH COME TO THE FAIR! THE FAIR? SAID HE,
BUT I&rsquo;M A BEAR! ALL BLACK AND BROWN, AND COVERED WITH
HAIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wrinkled old lady smiled. &ldquo;At Highgarden we have many
spiders amongst the flowers. So long as they keep to themselves we
let them spin their little webs, but if they get underfoot we step
on them.&rdquo; She patted Sansa on the back of the hand.
&ldquo;Now, child, the truth. What sort of man is this Joffrey, who
calls himself Baratheon but looks so very Lannister? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>AND DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE TO THERE. FROM HERE! TO
THERE! THREE BOYS, A GOAT, AND A DANCING BEAR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa felt as though her heart had lodged in her throat. The
Queen of Thorns was so close she could smell the old woman&rsquo;s
sour breath. Her gaunt thin fingers were pinching her wrist. To her
other side, Margaery was listening as well. A shiver went through
her. &ldquo;A monster,&rdquo; she whispered, so tremulously she
could scarcely hear her own voice. &ldquo;Joffrey is a monster. He
lied about the butcher&rsquo;s boy and made Father kill my wolf.
When I displease him, he has the Kingsguard beat me. He&rsquo;s
evil and cruel, my lady, it&rsquo;s so. And the queen as
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Olenna Tyrell and her granddaughter exchanged a look.
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Oh, gods</em>, thought Sansa, horrified. <em>If Margaery won&rsquo;t
marry him, Joff will know that I&rsquo;m to blame</em>.
&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she blurted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop the
wedding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Lord Puff Fish is determined that Margaery
shall be queen. And the word of a Tyrell is worth more than all the
gold in Casterly Rock. At least it was in my day. Even so, we thank
you for the truth, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>DANCED AND SPUN, ALL THE WAY
TO THE FAIR! THE FAIR! THE FAIR!</em>&rdquo; Butterbumps hopped and
roared and stomped his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sansa, would you like to visit Highgarden?&rdquo; When
Margaery Tyrell smiled, she looked very like her brother Loras.
&ldquo;All the autumn flowers are in bloom just now, and there are
groves and fountains, shady courtyards, marble colonnades. My lord
father always keeps singers at court, sweeter ones than Butters
here, and pipers and fiddlers and harpers as well. We have the best
horses, and pleasure boats to sail along the Mander. Do you hawk,
Sansa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>OH, SWEET SHE WAS, AND PURE, AND FAIR! THE MAID WITH
HONEY IN HER HAIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will love Highgarden as I do, I know it.&rdquo;
Margaery brushed back a loose strand of Sansa&rsquo;s hair.
&ldquo;Once you see it, you&rsquo;ll never want to leave. And
perhaps you won&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>HER HAIR! HER HAIR! THE MAID WITH HONEY IN HER
HAIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shush, child,&rdquo; the Queen of Thorns said sharply.
&ldquo;Sansa hasn&rsquo;t even told us that she would like to come
for a visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I would,&rdquo; Sansa said. Highgarden sounded
like the place she had always dreamed of, like the beautiful
magical court she had once hoped to find at King&rsquo;s
Landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE
SUMMER AIR. THE BEAR! THE BEAR! ALL BLACK AND BROWN AND COVERED
WITH HAIR</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the queen,&rdquo; Sansa went on, &ldquo;she
won&rsquo;t let me go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will. Without Highgarden, the Lannisters have no hope
of keeping Joffrey on his throne. If my son the lord oaf asks, she
will have no choice but to grant his request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he?&rdquo; asked Sansa. &ldquo;Will he
ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Olenna frowned. &ldquo;I see no need to give him a choice.
Of course, he has no hint of our true purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>HE SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE SUMMER AIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa wrinkled her brow. &ldquo;Our true purpose, my
lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>HE SNIFFED AND ROARED AND SMELLED IT THERE! HONEY ON THE
SUMMER AIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see you safely wed, child,&rdquo; the old woman said,
as Butterbumps bellowed out the old, old song, &ldquo;to my
grandson.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Wed to Ser Loras, oh</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sansa&rsquo;s
breath caught in her throat. She remembered Ser Loras in his
sparkling sapphire armor, tossing her a rose. Ser Loras in white
silk, so pure, innocent, beautiful. The dimples at the corner of his
mouth when he smiled. The sweetness of his laugh, the warmth of his
hand. She could only imagine what it would be like to pull up his
tunic and caress the smooth skin underneath, to stand on her toes
and kiss him, to run her fingers through those thick brown curls
and drown in his deep brown eyes. A flush crept up her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>OH, I&rsquo;M A MAID, AND I&rsquo;M PURE AND FAIR! I&rsquo;LL
NEVER DANCE WITH A HAIRY BEAR! A BEAR! A BEAR! I&rsquo;LL NEVER
DANCE WITH A HAIRY BEAR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like that, Sansa?&rdquo; asked Margaery.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a sister, only brothers. Oh, please say
yes, please say that you will consent to marry my
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words came tumbling out of her. &ldquo;Yes. I will. I would
like that more than anything. To wed Ser Loras, to love
him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Loras?</em>&rdquo; Lady Olenna sounded annoyed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, child. Kingsguard never wed.
Didn&rsquo;t they teach you anything in Winterfell? We were
speaking of my grandson Willas. He is a bit old for you, to be
sure, but a dear boy for all that. Not the least bit oafish, and
heir to Highgarden besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sansa felt dizzy; one instant her head was full of dreams of
Loras, and the next they had all been snatched away. <em>Willas?
Willas?</em> &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she said stupidly. <em>Courtesy is a
lady&rsquo;s armor. You must not offend them, be careful what you
say</em>. &ldquo;I do not know Ser Willas. I have never had the
pleasure, my lady. Is he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is he as great a
knight as his brothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>LIFTED HER HIGH INTO THE AIR!
THE BEAR! THE BEAR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Margaery said. &ldquo;He has never taken
vows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her grandmother frowned. &ldquo;Tell the girl the truth. The
poor lad is crippled, and that&rsquo;s the way of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was hurt as a squire, riding in his first
tourney,&rdquo; Margaery confided. &ldquo;His horse fell and
crushed his leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That snake of a Dornishman was to blame, that Oberyn
Martell. And his maester as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I CALLED FOR A KNIGHT, BUT YOU&rsquo;RE A BEAR! A BEAR! A
BEAR! ALL BLACK AND BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willas has a bad leg but a good heart,&rdquo; said
Margaery. &ldquo;He used to read to me when I was a little girl,
and draw me pictures of the stars. You will love him as much as we
do, Sansa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>SHE KICKED AND WAILED, THE MAID SO FAIR, BUT HE LICKED
THE HONEY FROM HER HAIR. HER HAIR! HER HAIR! HE LICKED THE HONEY
FROM HER HAIR!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When might I meet him?&rdquo; asked Sansa,
hesitantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; promised Margaery. &ldquo;When you come to
Highgarden, after Joffrey and I are wed. My grandmother will take
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the old woman, patting Sansa&rsquo;s
hand and smiling a soft wrinkly smile. &ldquo;I will
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>THEN SHE SIGHED AND SQUEALED AND KICKED THE AIR! MY BEAR!
SHE SANG. MY BEAR SO FAIR! AND OFF THEY WENT, FROM HERE TO THERE,
THE BEAR, THE BEAR, AND THE MAIDEN FAIR</em>.&rdquo; Butterbumps roared
the last line, leapt into the air, and came down on both feet with
a crash that shook the wine cups on the table. The women laughed
and clapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that dreadful song would never end,&rdquo; said
the Queen of Thorns. &ldquo;But look, here comes my
cheese.&rdquo;</p>
