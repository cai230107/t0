             "Back again," Carol said, held in my arms while Kathi looked 
        on,  perhaps a bit "puzzled" by my wife's tone of  voice...   The 
        rooms were cold, chilly, but the sun was streaming in through the 
        shutters, the sound of children playing in the "enclosure" formed 
        by  the  buildings faintly audible through  the  closed  windows.   
        Dularnian  cities are laid out in square blocks, with the  build-
        ings all fronting the street like a solid wall while the interior 
        of  the "block" is left open for a playground and  gardens.   The 
        idea of separate "yards" as such being almost completely  "alien" 
        to  any one of this era as is the idea of "private  property"  in 
        housing as we used to think of it in our own time.  Our own quar-
        ters  being  rather  similar in design to what  would  have  been 
        called a "town house" in the Twentieth Century.  Such design does 
        of course allow for a greater population density than what  would 
        be practical with a more "spread out" sort of housing, space  be-
        ing at somewhat of a premium in a walled city such as Arsana  is.  
        Such a design also has its advantages for military defense, as it 
        would force any invader to pass through the streets while subject 
        to fire from the roof tops on either side.  I might also add that 
        the  "roof top patios" above most Dularnian homes are often  used 
        in warm weather for entertainment and some degree of privacy.   I 
        might also note here that I've never seen windows on any house on 
        the first floor, which makes breaking into a house rather  diffi-
        cult without the use of something like a battering ram or the use 
        of ladders.  There is no such thing as "zoning" as such, although 
        heavy  manufacturing is not carried out in  "residential"  areas.  
        On  the  other hand you do not need to go far to buy  your  daily 
        "necessities",  and most people do travel by foot throughout  the 
        city,  often with their two wheeled little "carts" that you  pull 
        behind  you,  or have your slave girl "pull" for you if  you  are 
        "wealthy" enough to have such a delightful wench to serve you so.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Arsana is the largest city in Dularn, and measures about two 
        miles across.  The largest city I know of is Sarn, the capital of 
        California, which is built in the shape of a horseshoe and covers 
        a  considerably larger area due to the bay in the center  of  it.  
        It is doubtful at our present level of technology that a city  of 
        larger size than this would be practical in a society where  most 
        people  travel by foot to their destinations.*  Trella does  have 
        "public  mass  transit" in the form of horse drawn  trolleys,  an 
        "invention" of Lorraine's that Maris is hoping to someday "copy", 
        although  there is considerable "opposition" from those  now  en-
        gaged  here  in the trade of transporting people for  pay.   Most 
        people  who live in the city do not own horses or unicorns,  such 
        animals being quite expensive to keep, both due to their feed and 
        the "tax" that you must pay that is used to clean up the "messes" 
        the animals make on the streets when they "relieve" themselves.**
        
        *  The  bicycle is just a "curiosity" since the streets  are  not 
        "smooth" enough to make it practical nor is rubber available  for 
        the tires.  "Experiments" with animal skins have proved useless.
        
        **  There are "public restrooms" for the people spaced every  few 
        blocks along the streets.  These are quite "practical" in a soci-
        ety like ours with good social discipline.  The sort of  "vandal-
        ism" that I saw in the Twentieth Century doesn't exist in Dularn.  
        Children in this society (the same is true in California) are ex-
        pected to "mind their manners" or they get a good whipping  until 
        they do.  The people of this era are strict with their  children.  
        The type of "teen age activities" known in our time would not  be 
        "tolerated" anywhere in this era by the people of any country.  A 
        son  or  daughter who cannot be "controlled" is turned  over  the 
        "authorities" for "discipline".  For girls this is often slavery.  
        For men this means castration and lifelong work on a labor gang.  
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Nice having a `wench' around though," Carol smiled, sitting 
        there watching our slave girl.  Kathi busy at work taking care of 
        things, and seeing to our own comforts.  Her present attire being 
        such that one saw much of her legs, Kathi wearing only her leath-
        er halter and matching leather miniskirt.  As our home from  cel-
        lar to the roof top patio is five floors, she had ample  opportu-
        nity for "exercise" in climbing all the stairways.  It should  be 
        noted here that Kathi was also responsible for taking care of our 
        animals,  and  seeing to all the household chores, all  of  which 
        kept  her busy most of the day.  She was frequently  given  "time 
        off", and we did give her an "allowance" to spend upon herself...  
        The life of slave girls in a society like ours is not unpleasant.  
        Most masters are well aware of the fact that a "happy" slave girl 
        is more pleasant to have around than one who is always unhappy...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Especially  if her skirt is short and she's `built' like  a 
        brick palace," I smiled, seeing Kathi now look up at me and grin.  
        I often "patted" the wench whenever my wife wasn't around to see.  
        Kathi enjoying such "teasing", as many slave girls do, I  notice.  
        Like Carol, Kathi has strong female drives, and no "doubts" about 
        herself as a woman.  She is better "built" than my wife, but  not 
        as "good" in bed despite the fact that she tries hard to be so...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I think the `term' referred to a different sort of  `struc-
        ture',"  Carol laughed, sipping at her wine as we ate our  dinner 
        there on the third floor now overlooking the "enclosure" outside.  
        We  rarely  opened the windows on the "street" side any  more  as 
        there was nothing to see but just the buildings on the other side 
        of the street.  Such also tended to keep out the street noises... 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "In  any case she is a `pleasure to the eye',"  I  observed, 
        Kathi at the moment bending over to feed the fireplace.  The  de-
        sign of these fireplaces is such that they are quite "energy  ef-
        ficient"  in that they also serve to heat water at the same  time 
        for  the radiators that are commonplace in many Dularnian  homes.  
        One has the benefits of the open fire, and energy efficiency too.  
        A  grill work is built in the top of the fireplace through  which 
        the water is circulated.  Usually only the upper floors are heat-
        ed  in the colder months of the year, I might also mention  here.  
        Most Dularnian construction tends to be quite thick walled, which 
        also "helps", and one also "dresses" for the climate, of course.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I trust you do not find me `displeasing'," my wife teased.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You do `smell' a bit better," I answered, Kathi in need  of 
        a bath, I had noticed earlier whenever she stood too close to me.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Steel or iron will rust when exposed to sea water," the man 
        said,  looking up at his beautiful Queen standing there.  He  was 
        of  the caste of Builders, which in turn covered the  occupations 
        of  Engineering and Science, although the "latter" is also  split 
        among a number of other castes such as Physicians and Scribes.  I 
        was well aware of that fact, but didn't consider it "important".
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Paint will serve to protect it," Maris smiled back then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There is no provision for sails," the man protested then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It is powered by steam, not by the wind," Maris now smiled.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It  looks like something out of a sailor's nightmare,"  the 
        man said.  I tended to "agree" just a bit with him on that idea!
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I wonder if Lorraine has the same problems," Maris said  to 
        me  as the man left with the drawings.  The "fact" that  Lorraine 
        could build steam ships didn't mean that we could, I was aware...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "People raised in a `Twelfth Century' technology will have a 
        hard time dealing with that of the early Nineteenth," I answered.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "And what shall our `dreadnought' be called?" Maris asked.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That," I smiled, "I will leave up to the Queen of Dularn."
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Starting to `show' a bit now," Maris smiled, Carol nodding.  
        it  was late spring, the great bulk of the "DIANA" there  in  the 
        shipyard  having drawn its share of the idly curious.  The  news-
        papers had dubbed it "Simmons' Folly", it being held that no ship 
        without  sails would be of any "practical value" for warfare  de-
        spite the proven fact that Lorraine's steam frigates had "proved" 
        themselves  without doubt there on the southern coast of  Alaska.  
        The  shape of the hull, like that of a fish, had  aroused  suspi-
        cions  that perhaps we of the 20th Century knew little of  ships!  
        In the water it would give the impression of a great sea monster!  
        The "spines" that ran down the Diana's back were an added  touch!  
        The painted "eyes" and all the rest merely adding to the "look".
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Gives me a bit more of a `stake' in things," Carol said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I think that is `why' we have Queens," Maris smiled back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That  Prince of the Wyomings seemed to like you a bit,"  my 
        wife smiled.  That was a bit of an "understatement", I thought...  
        He'd been almost totally infatuated with Queen Maris, I'd  noted.  
        Such a marriage would have important political ramifications  for 
        Dularn,  especially  with Queen Valeris there to the  north  now.  
        The "Queen of the North" having spread her ideology of "feminism" 
        over a considerable area with the "help" of Imperial weaponry and 
        "advisors".  In this I suspected the hand of Lorraine, who was of 
        course well aware of Twentieth Century history and such "things".  
        Maris  was supplying the Wyomings with our weapons, along with  a 
        number  of "advisors" upon my suggestion, it being obvious to  me 
        that  eventually some day Dularn and Queen Valeris were going  to 
        clash, especially as she worked her way further to the south now.  
        In such a case it would be "wise" to have allies such as the Wyo-
        mings, whose cavalry might be more an "answer" to her wolves.   I 
        was also concerned about the Imperial "spy" we'd caught, no doubt 
        an agent of either Darlanis or Lorraine, who it could be expected 
        would view the construction of the Diana with some concern here.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "He did make me arch and moan like no man before," Maris an-
        swered in a quiet tone that she might not be overheard just then!  
        I had suspected that she had "given" herself to him, which  among 
        the  high born women of Dularn doesn't usually occur  unless  the 
        woman is very sure of her own emotional feelings towards the man.  
        The type of sexual promiscuity like in our era is almost unknown.  
        On the other hand prostitution is "legal" and quite commonplace.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "He is a rather `handsome' devil," Carol then smiled back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Who knows how to `pleasure' a woman," Maris assured her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Would master come," Kathi interrupted, now kneeling there.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "This  makes  the design more complex," the  chief  engineer 
        said to me, showing me the drawings that I had prepared for him.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It also allows to run both engines off of either boiler," I 
        now pointed out to him in reply, seeing him nod.  While it made a 
        "plumber's  nightmare" out of things a bit, I felt it would  also 
        make the ship more "reliable" especially under combat situations.  
        The Diana's top speed would be about seven knots.  Quite inferior 
        to that of even steam frigates under sail, but on the other  hand 
        we could make seven knots right into the teeth of the wind, which 
        no sailing ship, not even the well designed North Star could do!*
        
        *  The ship ended up with three engines and a top speed of  about 
        eleven  knots, which while not a match for the  "faster"  sailing 
        ships, did make the Diana much more "effective" as a ship of war.  
        The "appearance" of the vessel also helped in terrifying enemies.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Last  Sunday the High Priestess gave a sermon there at  the 
        Temple about the need of living in `peace' with one's neighbors," 
        the man spoke, looking me straight in the eye.  I was well  aware 
        that we were "pushing the law" quite a bit with the Diana and its 
        new weaponry.  "She said that in the `time of myth' that men  did 
        nothing  but build better ways of killing each other," he  added.  
        I had recently been running experiments with "carbide" cannons...  
        I suspected that the Priestesses of Lys had their own spies too.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She is right," I smiled, "But on the other hand if we allow 
        the Imperials to build ships and weapons that we have no  defense 
        against, then will our children `curse' our names as the flag  of 
        the Empire flies over Arsana?" I challenged him back.  He knew of 
        course that Carol was pregnant, that she was carrying our  child.  
        The "welfare" of one's children is taken seriously in this era.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We'd all feel better if you talked to her," he answered.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Neither Carol or I had ever paid much "attention" surprising 
        as it may seem to the Lys "religion" as such.  While we were well 
        aware that nearly everyone in this era followed their  teachings, 
        neither my wife or I have ever been "religious" people as such or 
        did we ever "belong" to any church back in the Twentieth Century.  
        Thus  as we stepped down from the taxi carriage in front  of  the 
        great temple that covers an entire city block here in Arsana,  we 
        felt  a certain degree of "awe" mixed with some "unease"  despite 
        the  fact that we both knew that what we were doing  was  "right" 
        whatever the High Priestess of the city said about our actions...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Impressive," Carol said, looking about.  We had I  supposed 
        passed it at one time or another, but we hadn't paid it much note 
        at the time.  Surprising as it may seem to the reader, there were 
        a lot of places in Arsana than we'd never seen despite the months 
        that  we'd lived here.  This "temple" being the  "mother  temple" 
        for the rest of the much smaller local temples here in Arsana.  I 
        might note here that "religion" is considered "important" in this 
        era, and that I have never met an "atheist" even among those  who 
        you might think would be one.  It is taken for "granted" that Lys 
        exists, that she is "Prime Cause" of everything as the Priestess-
        es  say.  The Priestesses themselves pointing to  Lorraine's  own 
        documented  experiences there on Mars when she supposedly met  up 
        with Lys, who the Imperial Warlady herself refers to as "SHE"...
