             "You sent for me?" I said, seeing Tais nod and smile in  re-
        turn.  The "attire" of the First Priestess utterly different than 
        usual!  The sky was cloudy, the drum roll of the thunder audible.    
        No  doubt the good people of Arsana were cursing this  change  in 
        the weather, although its "cause" was the woman there before  me, 
        a sort of strange looking device like a door frame behind her.  I 
        recalled  the  descriptions I'd read of the  mysterious  "Portal" 
        used  by the Women of Mars to travel between the Moon  and  their 
        own world.  I recalled what Lorraine had said of the device, what 
        Aurora had hoped to be able to "do" with it before the Priestess-
        es suddenly decided to take matters into their own hands back  in 
        2566 A.D.  Aurora having told Lorraine that there was another al-
        ien race in the solar system, beings who she had dubbed the "Oth-
        ers", these beings being the ones who had invented The Portal.  I 
        wondered  if there was any "truth" to these claims.  Tais  didn't 
        think so, saying that the Priestesses weren't "aware" of anyone.*
        
        * I believe from what has occurred that the Priestesses of Lys of 
        a future era are themselves the "Others".  I now believe that  in 
        a  future era they will refine the "Gateways" to the  point  that 
        they  can  travel back and forth in time to earlier eras  with  a 
        "means" of traveling about, perhaps using much modified Lorr sau-
        cers.  It is noteworthy that the Lorr themselves observed "flying 
        saucers" from time to time that they couldn't "explain" either...  
        Aurora's  own "comments" to Darlanis do indicate something  else!   
        There are no doubt "paradoxes" in "time travel", I believe now...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I have received permission to establish a permanent  `Gate-
        way' in time between `here' and your own era," Tais smiled  back.  
        That explained her clothing, the short leather skirt and  attrac-
        tive matching leather jacket.  I suspected she was a decade "ear-
        ly" in her choice of styles, but it didn't matter all that  much.  
        "This will allow us to carry out certain `studies' that would  be 
        otherwise impossible given the nature of time travel as it is..."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I didn't think there could be such a thing as a  `permanent 
        Gateway'  in time," I said looking at the device, recalling  what 
        she'd told me earlier when we'd spent a week back in 1991 waiting 
        for her books to come in at the public library there in Seaside.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We have made a `technological break-through'," she  smiled.  
        I  supposed that was possible.  The Priestesses are  "scientific" 
        in their thinking.  They take very little on "faith" as such.   I 
        suppose too the fact that they knew not "love" had its effects...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Isn't there a danger of `effecting things'?" I asked Tais.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "A certain degree of `caution' will be in order of  course," 
        Tais smiled back, the crash of the thunder audible now even  here 
        in the great Temple of Lys.  "That is why I wish to use your home 
        as our base in your time," the First Priestess said to me then...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Getting  `used'  to this now," I said to  Tais,  the  First 
        Priestess giving me a smile as I slid open the glass patio  door.  
        There  in the clearing behind us the pile of equipment  that  had 
        been sent through time with us to be set up in our utility  room.  
        Part  of the equipment was a transformer that Tais would hook  up 
        to the house's power supply, although the main source of  "power" 
        would be still six centuries in the future!  The Priestess in her 
        stylish leather attire looking little different than any woman of 
        this era, Tais being a striking blonde any man would  "notice"...  
        She does remind me considerably of Shannon Tweed in her "looks".
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Shouldn't take more than a couple hours to hook things up," 
        Tais smiled back.  She had the "idioms" of the Twentieth  Century 
        down pretty good now, having spent a week with Carol and me  here 
        in  this  time the last time we'd been here.   I  considered  her 
        "competent" at what she did, although the Priestesses' "reaction" 
        to the EVIL ONE hadn't indicated that they were "infallible"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Two  hundred  and forty volts is nothing to play  with,"  I 
        said,  Tais nodding, giving me a smile as we walked  towards  the 
        utility room there at the end of the mostly underground house.  I 
        supposed  she knew what she was doing.  Neither of us  had  given 
        any  thought to the "fact" that Man is not "alone" in  the  solar 
        system.  Tais had said that there was no way that anyone of  this 
        time could detect the operation of a "Portal", or of a  "Gateway" 
        for that matter.  On the other hand neither of us had thought  of 
        the  Lorr there on Mars, or of their lovely  feminine  Servitors.  
        Or of the "fact" that we could be very "altering things" here...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It  will `do'," Tais said, giving me a smile as she  looked 
        about.  I nodded, hoping she "knew" what she was doing here now.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Be careful," I said, holding the flashlight, Tais  nodding.  
        I was careful not to touch her, her own leather soled boots  per-
        haps giving her some protection should she short out the circuit.  
        It had been hard work setting up the Portal, and I was well aware 
        of the "fact" that Tais didn't smell all that "holy" right now...  
        She had wisely followed my "suggestion" to wear Carol's clothing.  
        She didn't look bad either in a pair of cut offs and a pull over.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I don't want to stand before Lys quite yet," she breathed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Do you actually believe in all that stuff?" I asked her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The `reality of Lys' is without `doubt'," Tais answered.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Is that `you' or a `Priestess' talking," I challenged her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Me," she replied, twisting the "hot" wire around the screw.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Probably be pretty `hard' being the First Priestess if  you 
        didn't."  Tais now tightening the connection down as I spoke.   I 
        wondered if the Pope believed in all the bullshit he talked here.  
        Tais says that Christianity was "founded" by men with sexual hang 
        ups.  By men who "lacked" something "vital".  I think it is true.  
        On the other hand the Priestesses themselves shouldn't talk here!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I would think after your `experiences' that you'd believe," 
        Tais  smiled,  closing the panel box.  I knew that there  was  an 
        "EVIL ONE", having met "Him" myself, but all the rest of the mum-
        bo jumbo that the Priestesses "preached" there in their Temples??
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I believe in you," I said, taking her by the arms,  looking 
        into those beautiful azure eyes.  "I trust what you say is true."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There's a certain amount of `illusion' in what we `do', but 
        the major tenets of what we teach is the Truth," she answered me.  
        "The very history of our organization is proof of `what' we are."
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It works," Tais said, a shimmering glow forming between the 
        frame.   She stepped forward, poked a stick into the warp  field, 
        the  stick itself suddenly "cut off" as part of it  now  appeared 
        six  centuries and fifteen hundred miles away from here!  I  won-
        dered how much "power" the device was drawing to work.  The light 
        had "dimmed" noticeably when the Portal was turned on, I'd seen.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You're pulling a lot of power," I pointed out to her then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "About a hundred amps," the First Priestess smiled in reply.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We're going to have to have the power company put in anoth-
        er line then," I said, well aware that Tais was drawing  electric 
        power to the point that we might soon be in trouble otherwise...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We should be all right for the time being," she smiled.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It  wouldn't `be' what you expect," Tais smiled, her  azure 
        eyes glowing into mine as she stood there dripping wet before me.  
        The black string bikini didn't really "conceal" that much either.  
        I had no doubts either that she had "read" my thoughts just then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You're still a beautiful woman even if you aren't," I said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "There are certain `advantages' in being as I am," she said, 
        sitting  down on the beach blanket beside me, the  gentle  breeze 
        now rippling the still waters of the little lake there before us.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm sure Carol would `agree' with that," I laughed in turn.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Tais," I said, looking over at her as she laid there beside 
        me,  her golden hair drying in the sunlight that  peeked  through 
        the leaves overhead.  Her beautiful azure eyes turning to me...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Yes!" she said, her eyes suddenly glowing hot!  I knew  she 
        had read the thoughts in my mind.  Understood what I understood!!  
        The "Others" had existed, and we both knew just "who" they were!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We  have to turn the Portal off!" she cried,  springing  to 
        her feet!  I remembered what Lorraine had said to me.  What Auro-
        ra had told her!  That the "Others" had "left" a Portal on Earth!  
        That over a period of centuries they had finally made it "work"!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Tais  was far ahead of me before we reached the  house,  the 
        First  Priestess moving in great bounds that carried her a  dozen 
        feet  at a time.  I knew that the Priestesses, at least  some  of 
        them possessed superhuman physical powers, but this was the first 
        time  I'd seen such powers in operation!  The silvery disc  there 
        in the clearing on its three landing struts left no doubts now!!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They  are inside," Tais hissed as I came gasping  up,  Tais 
        herself panting for breath from her own two hundred yard sprint.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Can you `locate' them?" I asked, well aware that Tais'  did 
        have  the power to detect the thoughts of others, hopefully  even 
        those  of the Lorr and their lovely feminine Servitors, who  were 
        the Women of Mars back in the 26th Century now.  I was also aware 
        of the "fact" that we dared not use lethal force for fear of  al-
        tering the future, although there was much less likelihood of any 
        danger here due to the fact these people were not of the Earth...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They are in the utility room," Tais answered me back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We need to take them by surprise," I said to her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That should not be too difficult," Tais smiled back.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Just  `hold'  it right there, `ladies',"  I  said,  holding 
        my  .30-30 at my hip.  I didn't dare "use" it, but they  wouldn't 
        of course know that.  Tais had my .38 Smith & Wesson on the Lorr, 
        as  "ugly" a thing as you'd ever want to look at.  They  do  look 
        like a carpenter ant "scaled" up about a hundred and fifty times.  
        The  three women in their silvery jumpsuits standing there,  each 
        glancing  at  each  other.  All three were  light  haired,  white 
        skinned.  Their attire well displaying their figures beneath  it.  
        Tais  says that they probably were from Leith, which lies  hidden 
        in the Sierras somewhere to the south of the "site" of Shalimar.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Step to one side," Tais snapped, a firm tone of "authority" 
        in her voice despite the fact that she was still nearly  naked...  
        "We  wish you no harm, but we will kill if forced to do so,"  she 
        added,  edging around towards the still operating Portal, I  fol-
        lowing her, keeping the Winchester aimed towards the three women.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You  are `not' of this world?" the Lorr asked, the  speaker 
        mounted between its antennae repeating its radio speech in words.  
        Its compound eyes like multifaceted jewels in that awful head  as 
        it turned its head, the light bulb above it well illuminating it.  
        It stood between our washer and driver, some ten feet in  length, 
        perhaps  a third of that in height.  I can understand why  people 
        "freaked out" when they encountered the Lorr.  They are "ALIEN"!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We are `visitors'," Tais answered, beckoning to me now.   I 
        thought of the "mysteries" of time travel, of the "fact" that the 
        Women would eventually figure out how to "work" this "Portal"  in 
        centuries to come.  I wondered if one of these women here was the 
        distant ancestor of Aurora, who was the true mother of Darlanis!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The man is `human', you are `not'," the Lorr replied  then.  
        I  recalled that these creatures had a "radar" sense  along  with 
        the  normal five senses that human beings had.  I suspected  that 
        the Lorr had detected something about Tais that wasn't "human"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You  go first, I'll follow," Tais ordered, standing  there.  
        I  did as she ordered, the .30-30 still clutched in my  hand,  my 
        only "attire" the swim briefs I'd worn here in the 20th Century.
