<a id="p3534" name="p3534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3534)">For the drive to the outer villages Moff exchanged their usual open-air car for a small enclosed bus. The reason wasn't hard to figure out; barely a kilometer out of Sollas the road began passing in and out of the patches of forest that had been visible from orbit. "Just a normal precaution," Moff explained about their vehicle at one point. "Cars are rarely attacked, even by krisjaws, but it does happen occasionally." Joshua shuddered a bit at the thought, wondering for the hundredth time what had possessed Pyre to go out into the forest alone&#151;and what had possessed Telek to <i>let </i>him go. The <i>Dewdrop </i>had been maddeningly uninformative on everything dealing with Pyre's mission; and Joshua, for one, found it uncomfortably suspicious. He and Justin had discussed in some length the mystery behind Pyre's presence here during the trip from Aventine, though without finding any good answers. The possibility that Telek might have brought Pyre along solely because his political view made him expendable wasn't one that had occurred to Joshua before; but it was occurring to him now, and he didn't care for it at all.</p>
<a id="p3535" name="p3535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3535)">But for the moment, at least, it was a low-priority worry. Pyre had demonstrated his ability to survive the Qasaman wilderness&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. and, besides, the biological breakthrough he and Telek had made last night was just too fascinating to ignore. Joshua's schooling had included only a bare minimum of the life sciences, but even he could see how radically different the Qasaman ecology was from anything known either in the Worlds or the Dominion and could guess at some of the implications. The contact team hadn't had a safe chance to discuss it among themselves yet, of course&#151;as far as their hosts knew, they should have no inkling of any of this. But Joshua could see the same thoughts and speculations in their eyes. Watching the brightly colored foliage outside the bus, he waited impatiently for Cerenkov to start the gentle probing Telek had suggested.</p>
<a id="p3536" name="p3536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3536)">Cerenkov's grip on his curiosity was apparently stronger than Joshua's, however, and he waited until the fifty-kilometer trip was nearly over before nudging the conversation in that direction. "I've noticed a fair sprinkling of smaller birds flying among the trees," he said, gesturing toward the window beside him, "but nothing that seems to be the size of the mojo or its female form of tarbine. Do they nest in trees in the wild, or do they raise their young in those quill forests on the bololins' backs?"</p>
<a id="p3537" name="p3537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3537)">"There is no need of nests or the raising of young," Moff told him. "A mojo's young are born with all the necessary survival skills already present."</p>
<a id="p3538" name="p3538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3538)">"Really? Doesn't the tarbine at least have to nest long enough to hatch the eggs?"</p>
<a id="p3539" name="p3539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3539)">"There are no eggs&#151;mojo young are born live. In this sense most of the bird-like Qasaman creatures are not true birds, by the old standards."</p>
<a id="p3540" name="p3540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3540)">"Ah." Joshua could almost see Cerenkov casting about for a question that wouldn't reveal that he knew Moff was being deliberately misleading. "I'm also interested in the relationship between the tarbines and bololins. Is the tarbine merely a parasite, getting a free ride but not contributing anything?"</p>
<a id="p3541" name="p3541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3541)">"No, the relationship is more equal than that. The tarbines often help defend their bololins against predator attack, and it's thought that they also help locate good grazing sites from the air."</p>
<a id="p3542" name="p3542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3542)">"I thought the bololins liked to travel along magnetic field lines," Rynstadt put in. "Can they just get off that path any time they want to go foraging?"</p>
<a id="p3543" name="p3543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3543)">Moff gave him an odd look. "Of course. They only use the magnetic lines as a guide to and from the northern breeding areas. How did you deduce the mechanism?"</p>
<a id="p3544" name="p3544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3544)">"The layout of Sollas was the major clue," Cerenkov replied before Rynstadt could do so. "Those wide avenues all point along the field lines, with no real provision for bololin herds going any other direction. I think Marck's question refers to the fact that when the herd we saw was coming through the city the people stood just barely inside the cross streets, as if they knew the bololins wouldn't stray even slightly off their path. One of those still aboard the ship had wondered whether they were actually constrained to follow their individual lines pretty closely."</p>
<a id="p3545" name="p3545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3545)">"No, of course not." Moff's quizzical look was edging toward suspicion. "Otherwise many would crash into buildings instead of finding their way into the streets. But how did your companion know where the people were standing?"</p>
<a id="p3546" name="p3546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3546)">Joshua's heart skipped a beat. The Qasamans hadn't shown the slightest indication that they knew about his implanted sensors, but he still abruptly felt as if every eye in the bus had turned in his direction. It jump-kicked him back to childhood, to all the times his mother had easily penetrated his innocent expression to find the guilt bubbling up beneath it&#151;</p>
<a id="p3547" name="p3547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3547)">But Cerenkov was already well on top of things. "We told them about it, of course," he said, his tone one of genuine puzzlement. "We described the whole scene while you were up there shooting. They were interested in the odd mojo mating pattern, too&#151;at least what I was able to tell them about it seemed odd to them. Was there some kind of ritual dance or pattern that I missed?"</p>
<a id="p3548" name="p3548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3548)">"You seem excessively interested in the mojos," Moff said, his dark eyes boring into Cerenkov's.</p>
<a id="p3549" name="p3549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3549)">Cerenkov shrugged. "Why not? You must admit your relationship with them is unique in human history. I know of no other culture where people have had such universal protection&#151;<i>defensive </i>protection, I mean, not just a widespread carrying of weapons. It's bound to have reduced every form of aggression, from simple assault all the way to general warfare."</p>
<a id="p3550" name="p3550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3550)">Joshua frowned as that fact suddenly hit him. So busy had he been observing the details and minutiae of Qasaman life that he'd missed the larger patterns. But Cerenkov obviously hadn't&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and if he was right, perhaps the Trofts had cause to worry after all. A human culture that had had the willpower to break the pattern of strong preying on weak would be long on cooperation and short on competition&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and a potential threat to its neighbors no matter what its technological level.</p>
<a id="p3551" name="p3551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3551)">Moff was speaking again. "And you think our little mojos deserve the credit?" he asked, stroking his bird's throat. "You give no credit to our people and philosophy?"</p>
<a id="p3552" name="p3552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3552)">"Of course we do," Rynstadt said. "But there've been countless cultures throughout history who've paid great lip service to the concepts of justice and freedom from fear without doing anything concrete for their citizens. You&#151;and in particular the generation which first began taming the mojos&#151;have proved humanity is capable of truly practical idealism. That achievement alone would make contact between our worlds worthwhile, certainly from our point of view."</p>
<a id="p3553" name="p3553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3553)">"Your world has difficulties with war, then?" Moff's gaze shifted to Rynstadt.</p>
<a id="p3554" name="p3554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3554)">"So far we've avoided that particular problem," Rynstadt answered cautiously. "But we have our share of normal human aggressions, and that occasionally causes trouble."</p>
<a id="p3555" name="p3555"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3555)">"I see." For a moment they rode in silence, and then Moff shrugged. "Well, you'll see that we aren't completely without aggression. The difference is that we've learned to direct our attention outward, toward the dangers of the wild, instead of inward toward each other."</p>
<a id="p3556" name="p3556"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3556)"><i>Dangerous indeed, </i>Joshua thought; and even Cerenkov's eyes seemed troubled as conversation in the bus drifted into silence.</p>
<a id="p3557" name="p3557"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3557)">A few minutes later, they reached the village of Huriseem.</p>
<a id="p3558" name="p3558"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3558)">Joshua could remember arguments aboard ship as to whether the rings around the villages were actually walls; but at ground level there was no doubt whatsoever. Made of huge stone or concrete blocks, painted a dead black, Huriseem's wall was a stark throwback to ancient Earth history and the continual regional warfare of those days. It seemed gratingly out of place here, especially after the discussion of only a few minutes earlier.</p>
<a id="p3559" name="p3559"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3559)">Beside him, York cleared his throat. "Only about three meters high," he muttered, "and no crenels or fire ports."</p>
<a id="p3560" name="p3560"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3560)">Moff apparently heard him. "As I said, there is no war here," he said&#151;a bit tartly, Joshua thought. "The wall is to keep out bololins and the more deadly predators of the forests."</p>
<a id="p3561" name="p3561"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3561)">"Why not build along the same open lines as Sollas?" Cerenkov asked. "That works well enough for the bololins, and I didn't see any predators getting in there."</p>
<a id="p3562" name="p3562"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3562)">"Predators are rare in Sollas because there are many people and there is a wide gap between city and forest. Here such an approach would clearly not work."</p>
<a id="p3563" name="p3563"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3563)"><i>So clear back the forest, </i>Joshua thought. But perhaps that was more trouble than a single village was worth.</p>
<a id="p3564" name="p3564"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3564)">The bus followed the encircling road to the southwest side of the village, where they found a black gate set into the wall. Clearly they were both expected and observed; the gate was already opening as they came within sight of it. The bus turned in, and Joshua glanced back to see it close behind them.</p>
<a id="p3565" name="p3565"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3565)">The wall and the forest setting had somehow led Joshua's subconscious to expect a relatively primitive, thatched-hut scene, and he was vaguely disappointed as he left the bus to find the buildings, streets, and people as modern as those they'd seen in Sollas. Three men waited off to the side, and as the last of the Qasaman escorts left the bus they stepped forward.</p>
<a id="p3566" name="p3566"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3566)">"Mayor Ingliss," Moff nodded in greeting, "may I present to you the visitors from Aventine: Cerenkov, Rynstadt, York, and Moreau."</p>
<a id="p3567" name="p3567"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3567)">Where Mayor Kimmeron of Sollas had been almost cheerful, Ingliss was gravely polite. "I welcome you to Huriseem," he said with a nod. "I understand you seek to learn about village life on Qasama. To what end, may I inquire?"</p>
<a id="p3568" name="p3568"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3568)"><i>So Qasaman suspicion isn't limited to the big cities. </i>Somehow, Joshua found that more of a disappointment than the lack of thatched huts.</p>
<a id="p3569" name="p3569"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3569)">Cerenkov went into his by-now familiar spiel about trade and cultural exchange, and Joshua allowed his gaze to drift around the area. Huriseem seemed to have none of the taller six-story-plus buildings of Sollas, and the colorful abstract wall paintings were also absent, but otherwise the village could have been a transplanted chunk of the larger city. Even the wall's presence was not intrusive, and it took him a moment to realize the structure's inside surface was painted with effectively camouflaging pictures of buildings and forest scenes. So <i>why is the outside painted black? </i>he wondered&#151;and with a flash of inspiration it hit him. <i>Black</i>&#151;<i>the same color as the tree trunks. A charging bololin must see the village as a giant tree and therefore goes around it. </i>And that meant&#151;</p>
<a id="p3570" name="p3570"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3570)">Reaching to his neck, he covered the pendant's translator mike. "I've got it," he murmured. "The Sollas street paintings make the place look sort of like a clump of forest&#151;same colors and everything. Keeps the bololins from shying away."</p>
<a id="p3571" name="p3571"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3571)">There was a long enough pause that he began to wonder if no one on the <i>Dewdrop </i>was monitoring the circuit. Then Nnamdi's voice came in over the earphone. "Interesting. Weird, but entirely possible. Depends partly on how good the bololins' eyesight is, I suppose. Governor Telek's still asleep, but I'll suggest this to her when she wakes up, see if she got any data on that last night."</p>
<a id="p3572" name="p3572"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3572)">"Fine," Joshua said, "but in the meantime can <i>you </i>find any sociological rationale for wanting those herds to come trampling through Sollas?"</p>
<a id="p3573" name="p3573"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3573)">"That <i>does </i>put into doubt Moff's assertion that they simply can't keep the bololins out, doesn't it?" Nnamdi agreed thoughtfully. "I'll work on it, but nothing comes immediately to mind. Wait a second&#151;face left a bit, will you?"</p>
<a id="p3574" name="p3574"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3574)">Joshua obediently turned his head a few degrees in the requested direction. "What is it?"</p>
<a id="p3575" name="p3575"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3575)">"That red-bordered sign near the gate&#151;haven't seen anything like it anywhere in Sollas. Let me get the visual translator going.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p3576" name="p3576"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3576)">Joshua held his head steady for a moment to give the tape a good image, then turned back to face the others. "Okay," Nnamdi said after a moment. "It says, 'Krisjaw hunts this month: the 8th and 22nd at 10.' Today's the eighth, I think, if the numbers we've seen elsewhere are accurate. Wonder why they bother to post a sign with the other comm lines they have."</p>
<a id="p3577" name="p3577"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3577)">"Maybe a village this small doesn't have the same wiring as Sollas does," Joshua suggested. It looked like Cerenkov and the Qasamans had about finished the preliminaries; Mayor Ingliss was gesturing toward an open car of the sort they'd used in Sollas all week. "I'll try to find out," he added and let his hand fall to his side.</p>
<a id="p3578" name="p3578"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3578)">Its mike open again, the translator came back online. "&#151;will be able to visit the farming areas later," Ingliss was saying. "At the moment many of the workers are out hunting, so there would be little to see."</p>
<a id="p3579" name="p3579"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3579)">"Is that the krisjaw hunt?" Joshua spoke up.</p>
<a id="p3580" name="p3580"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3580)">Ingliss focused on him. "Yes, of course. Only krisjaws and bololins are worthy of mass hunts, and you would have heard a warning siren if a bololin herd were approaching."</p>
<a id="p3581" name="p3581"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3581)">"Yes, Moff has mentioned krisjaws once or twice," Cerenkov said. "I get the impression they're dangerous, but we don't know anything more."</p>
<a id="p3582" name="p3582"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3582)">"Dangerous?" Ingliss barked a laugh. "Immensely so. Two meters or more in length, half that from paws to shoulder, with wavy teeth that can shred a man in seconds. Savage hunters, they threaten both our people and our livestock."</p>
<a id="p3583" name="p3583"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3583)">"Sounds a little like our spine leopards," Rynstadt commented grimly. "Native Aventinian predators that we've been fighting ever since we landed."</p>
<a id="p3584" name="p3584"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3584)">"It wasn't always that way here," Ingliss said, shaking his head. "The old legends say that krisjaws used to be relatively peaceful, avoiding our first settlements and willing to share the bololin herds with us. It was only later, perhaps as they realized we intended to stay, that they began to turn on us."</p>
<a id="p3585" name="p3585"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3585)">"Or as they found out humans were good to eat," York suggested. "Did this happen all at once or gradually?"</p>
<a id="p3586" name="p3586"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3586)">Ingliss exchanged glances with Moff, who shrugged. "I don't know," the latter said. "Records of those early years are spotty&#151;the malfunction that stranded us here ruined much of our electronic recording equipment, and interim historical records did not always survive."</p>
<a id="p3587" name="p3587"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3587)">Nnamdi's voice clicked in on the circuit. "Pursue this point, Yuri; everyone," he said. "If the krisjaws are really showing signs of intelligence we need to know that."</p>
<a id="p3588" name="p3588"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3588)">"The reason I asked," Cerenkov said, "was that if they really did 'realize' you were settling here, they might be a sentient species."</p>
<a id="p3589" name="p3589"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3589)">"Our own biologists have studied that question," Moff said, "and they think that unlikely."</p>
<a id="p3590" name="p3590"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3590)">"They don't show any great ability to learn, for example," Ingliss offered. "All the villages&#151;and some of the cities, too&#151;hold periodic hunts in which often as many as fifty villagers and visitors participate. Yet the krisjaws haven't learned to stay away from civilized areas."</p>
<a id="p3591" name="p3591"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3591)">The light dawned. "Ah&#151;so <i>that's </i>why you post a krisjaw hunt notice by the gate," Joshua said. "So anyone passing through will know about it, as well as just the local population."</p>
<a id="p3592" name="p3592"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3592)">Ingliss nodded. "Yes. It's an opportunity to practice the human predator's own hunting skill, and all who wish to come are welcome. Krisjaw hides are also very prestigious, and many people find the meat superior to that of bololins. If you'd arrived an hour sooner&#151;but, no, you haven't got mojos, of course. Nor weapons, I see."</p>
<a id="p3593" name="p3593"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3593)">"Sounds like you should be close to wiping the things out by now," York grunted.</p>
<a id="p3594" name="p3594"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3594)">"Actually, we are," Ingliss nodded, "at least in the inhabited regions of Qasama. I speak of them as dangerous and numerous, but in fact a 50-man hunting group is fortunate to return with one or two trophies. In the days when Huriseem was first built a man could stand atop the wall and shoot one each hour."</p>
<a id="p3595" name="p3595"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3595)">"You're lucky any of you survived," York said.</p>
<a id="p3596" name="p3596"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3596)">Ingliss shrugged, a more deliberate gesture than the Aventinian version. "As I said, we were fairly well established before they began threatening us in earnest. And by then our adoption of the mojos as bodyguards was also well underway. Ironically enough, that program was stimulated in large part by concerns over the krisjaws."</p>
<a id="p3597" name="p3597"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3597)">"But that's enough about ancient history," Moff put in. "We have a limited amount of time; if you wish to observe the village we'll need to begin at once."</p>
<a id="p3598" name="p3598"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3598)">For just a second Joshua thought he saw something odd in Moff's face. But then the Qasaman had turned away toward the open car pulled up behind Ingliss and his companions, and Joshua decided he'd imagined the whole thing.</p>
<a id="p3599" name="p3599"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3599)">Looking around curiously, he followed the others to the car.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p3600" name="p3600"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3600)">It had been literally decades since Telek had pulled the kind of all-night lab work she'd done the previous night&#151;and <i>never </i>had she done it via the waldoes of a remote analyzer. Clumping into the <i>Dewdrop</i>'s lounge around noon, she felt like a good computer simulation of death. "What's happening?" she asked Nnamdi, heading immediately for the cahve dispenser in the corner.</p>
<a id="p3601" name="p3601"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3601)">"What're <i>you </i>doing here?" he frowned up from the displays at her. "You're supposed to be in bed doing some REMs."</p>
<a id="p3602" name="p3602"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3602)">"I'm <i>supposed </i>to be running a mission," she growled back, bringing her steaming mug over and dropping into the seat beside his. "I can sleep <i>next </i>year. Bil still down?"</p>
<a id="p3603" name="p3603"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3603)">"Yes. Left a call with the bridge for four o'clock."</p>
<a id="p3604" name="p3604"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3604)">And Christopher had done little except watch and make occasional suggestions. <i>Amazing how tiring it can be to kibitz, </i>she thought acidly, then put him from her mind. "Is this the village Moff promised us?"</p>
<a id="p3605" name="p3605"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3605)">"Yes; Huriseem. The stately fellow screen left is Ingliss, the mayor. This seems to be their version of the marketplace we saw in Sollas. Minus the bololins."</p>
<a id="p3606" name="p3606"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3606)">"Then the place <i>is </i>walled?"</p>
<a id="p3607" name="p3607"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3607)">"Solidly. And Joshua brought up an interesting point about Sollas's wild color scheme a while ago."</p>
<a id="p3608" name="p3608"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3608)">Telek listened with half an ear as Nnamdi described Joshua's idea about the cities seeming like clumps of forest to the bololins, the remainder of her attention on the scent and taste of her cahve and on the organized chaos on the displays. With the smaller marketplace of the village, she realized for the first time that services as well as goods were on display. One booth seemed to be manned by a builder, with wood and brick samples on a back table and what looked like a floor plan on a computer display screen set on the front counter. <i>So why don't they do the whole thing via computer? </i>she wondered. <i>They like the personal contact? Could be.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p3609" name="p3609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3609)">Nnamdi finished his recitation and she shrugged. "Could very well be. I'll check later and see if the computer can make an estimate of the bololins' visual resolution. Sure seems stupid to help the bololins stampede your city, though."</p>
<a id="p3610" name="p3610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3610)">"That's almost exactly what Joshua said," Nnamdi nodded. "Could there be something we're missing here? About the bololins and people, I mean?"</p>
<a id="p3611" name="p3611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3611)">"I don't think we've got the whole society figured out after a week here, no," she said dryly. "What exactly did you have in mind?"</p>
<a id="p3612" name="p3612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3612)">"Well&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." He waved a hand vaguely. "I don't know. Some symbiotic relationship, like the people have with the mojos."</p>
<a id="p3613" name="p3613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3613)">"I'd call the mojos more pets than symbionts, myself, but given the bololin-tarbine arrangement the point is well taken." Telek frowned into space, trying to remember all the forms of symbiosis that existed on the Worlds. "About the only possibility I can think of is that banging away at the bololins helps drain off the city-dwellers' aggressions. Keeps them peaceful."</p>
<a id="p3614" name="p3614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3614)">"Oh, their aggressions aren't drained off, just rerouted," Nnamdi snorted, gesturing toward the display. "You missed the bargaining session at a jewelry store half a block back. These guys would put Troft businessmen to shame."</p>
<a id="p3615" name="p3615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3615)">"Hmm. Probably a logical avenue to channel it into, given the mojo ban on fighting. That and politics, maybe.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p3616" name="p3616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3616)">She trailed off. "Something wrong?" Nnamdi asked.</p>
<a id="p3617" name="p3617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3617)">"I'm not sure," she said, picking up the mike. "Joshua, do a slow three-sixty, would you?"</p>
<a id="p3618" name="p3618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3618)">The scenery shifted as Joshua complied, pausing occasionally as he pretended to look at some booth or other . . , and by the time he'd completed his circle Telek's odd feeling had become a cold certainty. "Moff is missing," she told Nnamdi quietly.</p>
<a id="p3619" name="p3619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3619)">"What?" He frowned, hunching his chair closer to the display as if that would do him any good. "Come on, now&#151;Moff doesn't even go to the bathroom unless the contact team's off in some corner where they won't get into anything."</p>
<a id="p3620" name="p3620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3620)">"I know. Yuri; everyone&#151;Moff's gone. Anyone know where he went or notice him leave?"</p>
<a id="p3621" name="p3621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3621)">There was a short pause. Then, at the edge of the display, Telek saw Cerenkov raise a hand to his pendant. "I hadn't even noticed. Governor," he said. "There're so many people around us here&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3622" name="p3622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3622)">"Which may be precisely why he picked this place," Telek cut him off with a grunt. "Has he said or done anything unusual this morning? Anyone?"</p>
<a id="p3623" name="p3623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3623)">There were four quick negatives. "All right. Everyone keep an eye out for him, without being too conspicuous about it, and try to notice his expression when he shows up."</p>
<a id="p3624" name="p3624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3624)">She turned off the mike and sat glaring for a moment at the noisy market scene. "What do you think it means?" Nnamdi broke into her thoughts.</p>
<a id="p3625" name="p3625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3625)">"Maybe nothing. I hope nothing. But I think I'm going to replay this morning's tapes, see if I can spot anything in Moff's behavior myself. Keep an eye on things; let me know if anything happens." Picking up her cahve, she stepped to an unused display in the corner and keyed for the proper records.</p>
<a id="p3626" name="p3626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3626)">"Should we alert Almo and the bridge?" Nnamdi asked.</p>
<a id="p3627" name="p3627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3627)">"The bridge, yes&#151;but don't make too big a deal of it." She hesitated. "And Almo&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;no, let's not bother him yet. There'll be plenty of time to talk to him when we've figured out what if anything is going on."</p>
<a id="p3628" name="p3628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3628)">"Right."</p>
<a id="p3629" name="p3629"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3629)">Telek turned to her display. The semidarkness there was interrupted by a flickering light, the Qasamans' version of a wake-up alarm. Shifting one way and then the other, the picture changed as Joshua rolled over and then sat up. "Rise and glow, Marck," he said to Rynstadt in the other bed. "Busy day coming up."</p>
<a id="p3630" name="p3630"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3630)">"So what's new about that?" the other returned in a sleepy voice.</p>
<a id="p3631" name="p3631"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3631)">Groping blindly for her cahve mug, Telek settled down to watch.</p>
<a id="p3632" name="p3632"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3632)">&#160;</p>
