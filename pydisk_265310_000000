<a id="p1493" name="p1493"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1493)">The cut grew shallower, though the thickness of the brush about it did not thin. Twice we came to spaces that must have been intended for observation posts, with seats before shelves on which snoopers or scopes could once have been bolted, but from the growth and uncleared condition of the runway, I thought it had been a long time since these had been used for such a purpose.</p>
<a id="p1494" name="p1494"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1494)">What lay to the north of the port was unfamiliar to me. This had always been the less populous section of the continent, with only a fringe of settled land, backed against wilderness, where only a few Security posts had been garrisoned by rotation. The projects once set up here had been the first abandoned.</p>
<a id="p1495" name="p1495"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1495)">Somewhere ahead were the hills that eventually joined the mountains across which we had come. I thought if we could reach that stretch of country, we would have a curtain from the flitter, for the infra-scope was notably erratic in broken country.</p>
<a id="p1496" name="p1496"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1496)">We came to the end of the slit when I struck my shin painfully against an obstruction. With searching hands I discovered a set of steps, so narrow as to hold but one foot at a time. There had been no sound of the flitter for some time. If they had come to earth, we now had the advantage, since we were trained to this, and they must be surer in space than planetside. Now was the time to put as much distance between us as possible. I said so.</p>
<a id="p1497" name="p1497"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1497)">"Can we get back&#151;to the Butte, I mean&#151;if we go north all the way?" Thad asked.</p>
<a id="p1498" name="p1498"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1498)">"Not soon. We shall have to circle west."</p>
<a id="p1499" name="p1499"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1499)">"There are no trails there."</p>
<a id="p1500" name="p1500"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1500)">"No. If we get far enough out, there are the Security posts."</p>
<a id="p1501" name="p1501"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1501)">Those posts, they must all be in ruins now. I remembered the one we had picked up by chance on the com. The wart-horn, sitting in the chair as one with a right, staring back at us. Somehow that memory now sent a small shiver coursing down my back.</p>
<a id="p1502" name="p1502"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1502)">We issued from the slit into what had clearly once been a road.</p>
<a id="p1503" name="p1503"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1503)">"Where are we?" Thad moved closer. "We&#151;we are in woods, aren't we?"</p>
<a id="p1504" name="p1504"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1504)">His uncertainty was well founded. Visibility was almost nil. I explored gingerly, and my hands encountered a springy wall of brush. By following that up as high as I could reach, I discovered they bent, or had been trained, inward, to meet in a thick mat overhead. I recognized this as one of the blind ways used in a mutant Reserve for the coming and going of observers.</p>
<a id="p1505" name="p1505"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1505)">But a mutant Reserve to the north? All I had ever heard of were over the mountains. However, general knowledge on Beltane was limited. There had been so many Security projects begun in the early years&#151;and many of them abandoned later&#151;that a hundred such could have had being in remote portions of the continent, unknown to settlers not directly concerned.</p>
<a id="p1506" name="p1506"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1506)">Now I dared to use my torch, knowing of old how well constructed and secret such ways were. We looked both ways down a tunnel formed from growing brush. This had been trained over a mesh of ro-steel, which resisted all assaults of weathering for years, and its matting made as thick a wall as one of the settlement structures. We had a choice, right or left, and the compass said left. No flitter could spot us from overhead. If this followed a pattern set on other Reserves, a number of low grade distort patterns had been installed in that mesh that would interfere with an infra-scope. Luck had brought us into a safe way&#151;for as long as it lasted.</p>
<a id="p1507" name="p1507"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1507)">It continued to puzzle me that so elaborate an observation installation had been so near to the port and yet unknown, for while I had not explored possible informative tapes with the same fervor Gytha applied to such research, I had prided myself on knowing as much as the next about the Reserves.</p>
<a id="p1508" name="p1508"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1508)">"What&#151;where is this?" Thad drew closer. Though we went single file here, he was near to treading on my heels.</p>
<a id="p1509" name="p1509"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1509)">"A mutant observation run, as far as I can tell. As to where&#151;no Reserve listed now. Ah&#151;" We had come to what was apparently a dead end of brush, but this I knew how to deal with. I had Thad hold the torch while I hunted among tendrils of vine and twig ends for the release that must be there. Only, after I had found it, I had a struggle to force it open, proving that this way had not been used for a term of years. Branches parted and vines tore as we united our strength to break through.</p>
<a id="p1510" name="p1510"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1510)">Before us was what I wanted least to see, open ground&#151;and not only open ground, but also boggy territory. Clumps of vas reeds were almost as tall as the trees we had left. They still wore their wide summer crowns as fans to catch even the smallest breath of wind, so they were always in motion, striking one against its neighbor with click-clicks of stiff fronds, dislodging with every blow some of the fruit developed at the end of those fronds.</p>
<a id="p1511" name="p1511"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1511)">In addition to the vas reeds, there were grotesque humps of hortal, a fungi growing in weird lumps, to die quickly, riddled by flying things and animals for homes. They were unsafe to touch simply because they were so occupied that one never knew what kind of stinging or biting inhabitant might be decanted in a fury.</p>
<a id="p1512" name="p1512"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1512)">Straight into the bog led a pathway of rocks, now overgrown and discolored by algae and mosses, while above the muck, the slime-ringed pools, and all the other traps for the unwary danced or stood, like evil greenish candles, the swamp fires. This was as foreign to the Beltane I had always known as if, in coming through the tunnel, we had crossed space to another world.</p>
<a id="p1513" name="p1513"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1513)">"Do we go through there?" Thad wanted to know.</p>
<a id="p1514" name="p1514"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1514)">Someone once had and often enough to need the road but I had little inclination to follow. We could retrace our steps and explore the other end of the covered way, though it ran directly opposite from where we wanted to go.</p>
<a id="p1515" name="p1515"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1515)">The effluvia of the swamp reached our noses as the vas reeds rattled loudly under a rising wind. This way was risky even by day I decided. I was about to turn back when I heard a shout from the trail we had followed. It must be that our hunters had fallen into the slit and so were still on our track. If we retreated, we would come face to face with them.</p>
<a id="p1516" name="p1516"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1516)">I studied that broken stone road with closer attention than I had earlier given it. As far as I could see, it must follow some ridge of high land. None of it disappeared in a scummed pool, nor was it matted by reeds. Then, startled, I realized that in spite of the dark of the night, I was able to see those stones, that they appeared to be coated with some phosphorescence, which made them clear to sight. Thus, this path must have been meant to be traced in darkness. Were what the observers wished to spy on nocturnal?</p>
<a id="p1517" name="p1517"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1517)">"We'll have to go this way," I decided. And I took the first step.</p>
<a id="p1518" name="p1518"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1518)">I believed that those who followed after, wearing metallic plated boots, might have trouble, for the stones seemed coated with some slippery substance, but our soft-soled forest gear planted us firmly as long as we did not hurry. For a time we went straight out into the bog, the odors of its foulness rising about us. The vas reeds now grew thicker, and when the road curved to the left, they curtained off the back trail.</p>
<a id="p1519" name="p1519"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1519)">Since our eyes were well adjusted to the dark, the glow of the stones was enough to lead us on. I did not try to use a torch. We were well into that dismal land when we came to an island rising so much higher above the general level of the bog that five of the stones had been set in the slope of the hillock to make a stair to its surface.</p>
<a id="p1520" name="p1520"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1520)">The top of the hill-island had been smoothed, though bushes and matted grass proclaimed that it had gone unvisited for years. In its center were a series of pens resembling those we had seen at the mutant station&#151;a place where mutants had been kept before release into an environment attractive to them?</p>
<a id="p1521" name="p1521"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1521)">This could also be the dead end of the road, and I began to think my choice had been stupid. I wasted no time in crossing to the other side of the hill. Here again steps, but these only brought us down to what had manifestly been a landing place for flitter or hopper.</p>
<a id="p1522" name="p1522"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1522)">That was walled in with the glowing stones, others of which had been set around as markers to be seen from the air. Why had it been necessary to deliver cargoes here by night? All this suggested nothing else.</p>
<a id="p1523" name="p1523"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1523)">We paced along the wall of the space on three sides. There was no break in it anywhere to say that the road led on, but finally I dared to use belt torch, beaming beyond the wall, hunting some possible foothold on through the swamp.</p>
<a id="p1524" name="p1524"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1524)">What it brought into view was a ridge of higher ground, much the same as the one that had supported our road in, save there was no pavement of stones on this. If it were a continuation of the road, then it could support us, but to use it was a gamble.</p>
<a id="p1525" name="p1525"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1525)">We climbed back to the place of cages. For the first time I saw a small structure, no larger than the cages but with walls of mesh covered, as had been the tunnel, with living growth.</p>
<a id="p1526" name="p1526"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1526)">Its door was open, but the vines of the wall had laced across that, barring entrance until we cut our way. This had been, I thought, as I flashed the torch cautiously about, fashioned for the same blending-with-the-landscape concealment as the stations on the Reserves. And it was never meant for more than a temporary shelter.</p>
<a id="p1527" name="p1527"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1527)">Like the mountain lodge, it was bare of any furnishing, save for two bunks built into the walls, now covered with a layer of evil-appearing fungi. It smelt vilely of damp.</p>
<a id="p1528" name="p1528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1528)">Thad gave a quick exclamation, and I saw the flicker of stunner beam shoot to my right. Then his torch caught and held a thing that lay kicking very slowly until the full effect of the ray took and it was still, its belly upturned, its tearing claw starkly revealed.</p>
<a id="p1529" name="p1529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1529)">A koth crab&#151;nasty enough when it leaped before one could bring it down. And behind it a web of its fashioning with some swirling movements in it&#151;</p>
<a id="p1530" name="p1530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1530)">"Out!" I backed, Thad with me. Not just one crab, but a nest of them!</p>
<a id="p1531" name="p1531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1531)">What other unpleasant dwellers this hillock might have I did not know, but I had no desire to discover. We would have to turn back now&#151;only when we reached the end of the hill, we heard that sound, saw the wedge of a beamer aimed from above&#151;the flitter had trailed us!</p>
<a id="p1532" name="p1532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1532)">I grabbed the torch from the fore of my belt and thrust it back into the hut, having set it to give the appearance of someone inside.</p>
<a id="p1533" name="p1533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1533)">"Come on!"</p>
<a id="p1534" name="p1534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1534)">We hurried to the lower landing space, over its wall, to that ridge of hard ground that might or might not run to the other side of the bog. If they were hunting by sight now and not by scope&#151;but we dared not hope for such a favor from fortune. At least, seeing the light, they might delay by the hillock.</p>
<a id="p1535" name="p1535"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1535)">Now we had to move by the feel of the ground under us, and that was a treacherous guide. After we had gone a short way, though, the surface under my boots felt as solid as the stone had been. I slashed with my woods knife and cut off a length of vas reed. With this in hand, I tapped the way ahead, testing for any change in the surface or for a turn we could not see, though the eerie marsh lights played here and there, giving a faint light.</p>
<a id="p1536" name="p1536"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1536)">The unmistakable sound of a flitter settling came from behind, and for that I gave a sigh of relief. They had caught a glimpse of the landing stage and set down there, perhaps beaconed in by the torch left in the hut, which meant they no longer hunted by scope&#151;or they would have known that for a decoy.</p>
<a id="p1537" name="p1537"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1537)">Suddenly, under my rod there was no surface. In panic I quested to right and left, hoping that loss meant a change in direction and not an end to our narrow margin of safety. It did, for slightly to the left once more there was firm meeting of reed and ground.</p>
<a id="p1538" name="p1538"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1538)">From then on it was a matter of nerves. We fought tension, for the path no longer ran straight but wavered right and left, then right again. Each time it changed made us fear we had reached its end.</p>
<a id="p1539" name="p1539"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1539)">I began to think that this ridge was not natural but had been thrown up for some purpose, though it was not paved. It wove back and forth too much to be normal high ground. Now the marsh lights were fewer and behind us. We still moved through the stink of stagnant pools, and things slid, slipped, and splashed away from our coming. We expected at any moment that which might not flee but stand to dispute our passage.</p>
<a id="p1540" name="p1540"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1540)">At last the ridge skirted the edge of a small lake. I heard Thad gasp and might have echoed his exclamation of astonishment.</p>
<a id="p1541" name="p1541"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1541)">What we saw were lights&#151;not the marsh fires, nor any torches such as those the flitter might have used, but pale living bars of a chill glimmer that had much in common with the earlier road stones.</p>
<a id="p1542" name="p1542"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1542)">Of the stones! It did come from stones! They had been set in rough pillars, not in any regular pattern, but here and there. Between those pillars, which rose out of the surface of the dark water, were rough mounds plastered together above the surface with mud and reeds in rude masses.</p>
<a id="p1543" name="p1543"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1543)">"Wart-horns!" Thad cried in a half whisper.</p>
<a id="p1544" name="p1544"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1544)">Wart-horns, yes. But never had I seen a whole village of them so gathered. Wart-horns were generally solitary creatures, a small family perhaps in a single pond. Yet here I counted some twenty of the mud and reed mounds with the pillars between them.</p>
<a id="p1545" name="p1545"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1545)">Nothing troubled the water's surface, and as I saw from one of the nearer mounds (there was a hole in it a little above the water level), they might be abandoned. Yet it was something so far out of the normal for that species that it was worrying, and one learned early on Beltane that it was best never to let the extraordinary pass without note.</p>
<a id="p1546" name="p1546"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1546)">We edged along the narrow path and so passed very close to one of the pillars. I saw that it was indeed a makeshift structure, the stone having been plastered together with the same mud and reed mixture as formed the sides of the domes. Wart-horn doing? But why? Wart-horns were not intelligent enough to work out such a system of lighting.</p>
<a id="p1547" name="p1547"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1547)">The stones were uniform, exactly like the blocks that had formed the roadway to the island. I suddenly went down on one knee and ran my hand over the ground. So doing, one could feel indentations, though they were seasons old and much worn away. The pillars had been built of road stones!</p>
<a id="p1548" name="p1548"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1548)">Watching those domes warily, we felt our way along. There was this to hearten us. While the wart-horns liked water to base their dwellings, they did not live entirely within the swamps, for they needed certain foods that grew on higher land, so they must here be near the edge of the bog.</p>
<a id="p1549" name="p1549"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1549)">With the graying of the dawn sky, we were again on solid land, the swamp well behind us, and we had not heard the flitter again. The road that had guided us through the morass ended abruptly at a second park for transportation. I searched the ground ahead for some sign of a cave or like shelter. We were lagging, and we could go little farther without rest.</p>
<a id="p1550" name="p1550"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1550)">"Vere!"</p>
<a id="p1551" name="p1551"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1551)">I turned my head. Thad was pointing eagerly at the cliff wall a little ahead.</p>
<a id="p1552" name="p1552"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1552)">"Eeopoe, Vere!"</p>
<a id="p1553" name="p1553"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1553)">I saw it, too, the turn of broad-billed head, the flash of brilliant orange and white. It soared high and then shot down and seemed to disappear directly into the rock of the cliff. We started for that point. The eeopoe is a cave dweller, liking to set its nest, a plaster of feathers and moss and a secretion of fluids from its mouth, directly on the side of some opening. It nests in the dark but comes forth to hunt insects. Thus, our fortune had held that we saw it at all.</p>
<a id="p1554" name="p1554"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1554)">Had it not been for the bird, we would never have found the cave, for there was a towering rock to mask the entrance. One had to squeeze through a narrow slit between that and the parent cliff in order to enter at all. We found ourselves in a twilight, sandy-floored space.</p>
<a id="p1555" name="p1555"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1555)">This was not lava formation, and I had no intention of going too far in&#151;just enough to deaden any scope the hunters might have on us. But we were free now to light the remaining torch.</p>
<a id="p1556" name="p1556"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1556)">The narrow inlet was like the neck of a bottle and, through that, was a strange place indeed. Though our travels through the lava caves had been good practice in underground oddities, the light showed us something new.</p>
<a id="p1557" name="p1557"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1557)">From the cave floor sprang a dense growth of pure white vegetation about knee high. It had rooted from seeds dropped by the eeopoes, whose murmuring calls sounded in strange, echoing moans over our heads. Some of the sprouts had already withered and died; others still fought for a doomed life. Thad lifted the rays from that ghostly growth, and it shown in the eyes of the birds on the nests until they stirred restlessly.</p>
<a id="p1558" name="p1558"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1558)">There was another sound at floor level, a scurrying. Thad flashed his light downward to catch a furry rump and puff tail&#151;a weaver-brod. That tail whisked out of sight into a huge topple of nest, made partly of withered fronds from the ghost garden, partly of debris brought from without. The whole mass was almost waist high where it was packed against the far wall and must have been gathered by more than one generation of brods. The characteristic weaving of grass lengths was broken and crumbling in places, but it was clear the nest was still very much inhabited.</p>
<a id="p1559" name="p1559"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1559)">We avoided the ghost garden and the brod nest, also those portions under the eeopoe nests where there were showers of an unpleasant nature marked on the walls and fouling the ground sand. That left us a narrow strip on which to hunker down, the torch burning to the continual worriment of the birds, while we ate sparingly of our supplies. Then I brought out the map to try to plan ahead.</p>
<a id="p1560" name="p1560"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1560)">Sentry watch we took by turns. Twice more we ate. The eeopoes became accustomed to our company when we turned off the torch and would make their swift flights out and back. Timing by my watch told us we spent a day and a half in that hiding. This would, I hoped, baffle our pursuers into giving up. Yet I could not risk staying too long for fear they might cast southward and pick up the Butte.</p>
<a id="p1561" name="p1561"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1561)">The folly of our com calls was now apparent. Should Annet try again during our absence, she might beam in their destruction. The last hours spent in the cave were hard; we wanted so much to be on the move.</p>
<a id="p1562" name="p1562"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1562)">At last we followed the eeopoes out at dusk. There was no sign we had been trailed this far. Now we had to aim directly by compass, south and west once more. This was not easy country in which to follow any straight bearing, for it was rough, foothill land.</p>
<a id="p1563" name="p1563"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1563)">We skirted the swamp for the first night's journey. But we had the moon, sometimes entirely too much of it. There was no need to feel out every step, and we moved at a faster pace. I kept watching for a wart-horn trail. Such a group of them as suggested by the village in the lake would certainly leave a very noticeable regular swamp exit.</p>
<a id="p1564" name="p1564"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1564)">When we finally came upon that "road," I was startled, in spite of my anticipation, by the width and depth of the paw-pounded expanse. It was wide enough to accommodate a ground car, and it was worn below the surface of the surrounding soil as if it had been a main thoroughfare for generations of the creatures.</p>
<a id="p1565" name="p1565"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1565)">I had certainly no curiosity as to where it led. Having seen traces it was still in use, I wanted only to leave it behind. Wart-horns were not formidable creatures alone, but a pack (unknown heretofore) might be prudently avoided.</p>
<a id="p1566" name="p1566"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1566)">We hurried on until the swamp veered to the south, and we took a path more to the west. Meanwhile, we listened for the flitter, but when we were able to make such good time without hearing or seeing anything that suggested we were still the object of a search, we relaxed somewhat, but not enough to walk into the trap they had set.</p>
<a id="p1567" name="p1567"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1567)">I had no scope, but I did have something that anyone with even limited Ranger training developed speedily or else was no aid to such service at all&#151;a sixth sense of warning. I stopped short as we came to where we must round an abutting pillar of rock, throwing out my arm as a barrier to halt Thad also.</p>
<a id="p1568" name="p1568"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1568)">Instead of advancing, I inched back, pushing Thad. I listened, tried to sniff any alien odor (though scent is the least of all warning for my species). There was no sign of danger ahead&#151;except that I <i>knew</i> something waited for us there.</p>
<a id="p1569" name="p1569"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1569)">With a last rush I threw myself back into a pocket behind the rock, carrying Thad, half under me, to the ground. We lay there for a long moment, listening.</p>
<a id="p1570" name="p1570"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1570)">I do not know how they knew their trap had failed. Perhaps they had the scope at their service to tell them we were near. They were hard driven, so hard driven that they tried now openly what they had failed to accomplish with their ambush.</p>
<a id="p1571" name="p1571"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1571)">"We know you are there."</p>
<a id="p1572" name="p1572"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1572)">The voice boomed among the rocks as it had in the air near the port. "We mean you no harm. We need your help&#151;truce oath."</p>
<a id="p1573" name="p1573"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1573)">Truce oath? Yes, once there had been such promises, and men had kept them. But for what had happened here on Beltane&#151;after what we had seen&#151;there was no trust in the "honor" of those we faced.</p>
<a id="p1574" name="p1574"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1574)">"You need us, we need you&#151;" the voice continued, and there was a note of desperation in it.</p>
<a id="p1575" name="p1575"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1575)">"Look, we'll disarm. See&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1576" name="p1576"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1576)">Out into the moonlight beyond the rock spun weapons, four of them. They clanged down on the stone and gravel and lay with the light shimmering on them; a blaster, two lasers, and another piece I could not identify but had no doubts was just as deadly as the other two&#151;perhaps more so.</p>
<a id="p1577" name="p1577"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1577)">"We're coming out now&#151;empty hands&#151;truce oath&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1578" name="p1578"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1578)">I could see their shadows before I saw them. I readied my stunner and saw Thad do likewise.</p>
<a id="p1579" name="p1579"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1579)">There were three of them, and we did not see their faces plain, for they had their backs to the light. They moved slowly, as if each step was an effort. Though they held their hands high, palms out, I saw one come to a halt and touch his forehead with his right hand. I remembered the disease symptoms, and I froze in fear.</p>
<a id="p1580" name="p1580"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1580)">"Now," I whispered to Thad, "give them full beam!"</p>
<a id="p1581" name="p1581"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1581)">&#160;</p>
