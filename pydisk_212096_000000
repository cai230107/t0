<h2 class="chapter">59</h2>

<p>Time had no meaning. The Shadowmaster&rsquo;s camp lay somewhere
north of Dejagore. We four were among the earliest prisoners taken
but more soon joined us in our pen. Lots of Mogaba&rsquo;s guys
wanted to leave town.</p>

<p>He would have less trouble feeding the ones who stayed
behind.</p>

<p>One-Eye and Goblin seemed to hold our part of town together.
Nobody I knew became a prisoner.</p>

<p>I did not send any more moths so they knew I had found trouble
instead of Lady.</p>

<p>Even our guards had no notion how Spinner meant to use us. We
were happier not knowing, probably.</p>

<p>I spent uncounted days in total misery. Piglets in a feed lot
live better than we did. More and more prisoners arrived. The food
was inadequate. After a few meals everybody got the runs. There
were no sewage provisions, not even a simple slit trench. They
would not let us dig our own. Maybe they did not want us getting
too comfortable.</p>

<p>In fact our life was not much worse than that of the
Shadowlander private soldiers. They had nothing anymore and could
expect only nothing. They indulged in a ferocious desertion rate
despite the Shadowmaster&rsquo;s reputation. They hated
Shadowspinner for putting them into such an awful state. They took
their anger out on us.</p>

<p>I do not know how long we were there. I lost track. I was busy
trying to die from dysentery. I noticed only that there was a
sudden absence of crows one day. I was so used to having crows
around that anymore I noticed them only when they were not
there.</p>

<p>I faded in and out. I suffered a bunch of my spells. They were
more frequent now and left me emotionally drained. The shits left
me physically drained.</p>

<p>If I could only get some sleep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sindhu wakened me. I recoiled from his touch. It was
astonishingly cold and seemed vaguely reptilian. I was the only man
in the pen he knew so he wanted to be my pal. I was willing to do
without a friend. He offered me a cup of water. It was a rather
nice tin cup. Where did he get that? &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clean water.&rdquo; All around us prisoners lay
in the mud twitching endlessly in haunted sleep. Some cried out.
Sindhu continued, &ldquo;Something is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt the breath of the goddess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant I smelled something that was not the stink of
vomit or unwashed bodies or dead men or pools of liquid shit,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Sindhu whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening
now.&rdquo; I looked where he pointed.</p>

<p>The happening something was going on inside the big tent
belonging to the Shadowmaster. Lights of strange color flickered
and flared. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s getting something special ready
for somebody.&rdquo; Maybe he had Lady spotted.</p>

<p>Sindhu snorted. He seemed to thrive in these conditions.</p>

<p>The something went on a long time but attracted no attention. I
became suspicious. I had Goblin&rsquo;s ward against sleep spells
set on me. Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? I dragged myself to the
compound fence. When nobody smashed me back with the butt of a
spear I was sure. The camp was under an enchantment.</p>

<p>Sindhu&rsquo;s water gave me strength quickly and started my
brain perking. It occurred to me that if no one was inclined to
stop me this might be the perfect time to take leave of the
Shadowmaster&rsquo;s hospitality. I started worming my way between
the fence rails.</p>

<p>My stomach rumbled in protest. I ignored it. Sindhu grabbed my
arm. His grip was iron. He said, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I waited. What the hell? That was one of my favorite arms. I
didn&rsquo;t want to deprive myself of its company.</p>

<p>The moon began to rise, a big old squashed orange egg in the
east. Sindhu continued to restrain me and continued to stare at the
big tent.</p>

<p>A shriek drifted down from high above. &ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo;
I muttered. &ldquo;Not him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sindhu cursed, too. He was so startled that he let me go. He
glared upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Howler,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Really
bad news. Shadowspinner could take advanced cruelty lessons from
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The side of Spinner&rsquo;s tent opened. Out rushed a bunch of
people carrying what proved to be human body parts. I recognized
some of them. The people, that is. Who could mistake Willow Swan
with his wild yellow mane? Or Lady, who carried a severed head by
its mangy hair? And Blade was only a step behind her, his ebony
skin shiny in the moonlight. I did not recognize any of the
others.</p>

<p>The sleep spell on the camp, laid rather poorly, unravelled.
Southerners jumped up to ask what was happening. Metal clanged and
jingled as weapons and mail were located.</p>

<p>One of Lady&rsquo;s companions, a huge Shadar, started bellowing
something about bowing down to the true Daughter of Night.</p>

<p>Sindhu chuckled. Nothing bothered him, it seemed. He could take
anything.</p>

<p>He was not holding on to me but I no longer had the strength or
inclination to go anywhere.</p>
