<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Thirty-seven: SHADOWLIGHT: COAL-DARK
TEARS</h2>

<p>Rage and panic contended in the fountained hall at Shadowlight.
Moonshadow mewled dire prophecies. Stormshadow raged. One
maintained a silence as deep as that within a buried coffin. And
one was not there at all, though a Voice spoke for him, dark and
mocking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said a million men might not be enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, worm!&rdquo; Stormshadow snarled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have obliterated your invincible armies, children.
They have forced bridgeheads everywhere. What will you do now,
whimpering dogs? Your provinces are a prostrate and naked woman. A
two-hundred-mile jaunt behind the Lance of Passion and they will be
hammering at the gates of Stormgard. What will you do, what will
you do, what will you do? Oh, woe, what hast befallen thee?&rdquo;
Insane laughter rolled out of that black absence in the air.</p>

<p>Stormshadow snarled, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been a whole hell
of a lot of help, have you? You and your games. Trying to catch
Dorotea Senjak? How well did you do? Eh? What would you have done
with their Captain? Did you have a bargain in mind? Some deal to
trade us for the power they bring? Did you think you could use them
to close the Gate? If you did you&rsquo;re the greatest fool of
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whine, children. Moan and wail. They are upon you. Maybe
if you beg I&rsquo;ll save you yet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moonshadow snapped, &ldquo;Bold chatter from one without the
ability to save himself. Yes. In the traditions of their Company
they caught us off balance. They did what is for them old routine:
the impossible. But the fighting along the Main was just one move
in the game. Only a pawn has vanished from the board. If they come
south, every step will carry them a step nearer their
dooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughter.</p>

<p>The silent one broke his fast of words. &ldquo;There are three
of us, in the fullness of our power. But two great ones dog the
path of the Black Company. And they have little interest in
furthering its goals. And she is a cripple, feeble as a
mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More laughter. &ldquo;Once upon a time someone named the true
name of Dorotea Senjak. So now she is the Lady no more. She has no
more powers than a talented child. But do you believe she lost her
memory when she lost those powers? You do not. Or you would not
accuse me as you have. Perhaps she will grow frightened enough or
desperate enough to confide in the great one who
changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No retort. That was the dread that haunted them all.</p>

<p>Moonshadow said, &ldquo;The reports are confused. Still, a great
disaster has befallen our army. But we are dealing with the Black
Company. The chance has always existed. We have prepared for it. We
will regain our composure. We will deal with them. But there is a
mystery from the fighting at Ghoja. Two dire figures were seen
there, great dark beings on giant steeds that breathed fire. Beings
immune to the bite of darts. The names Widowmaker and Lifetaker
have been breathed by those who stood with the Black
Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was news to the others. Stormshadow said, &ldquo;We must
learn more about this. It may explain their luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hole in the air: &ldquo;You must act if you do not want to
be devoured. I suggest you put aside terror, eschew squabbling, and cease the dispensation of accusation. I suggest
you think of a way to go for the jugular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will contribute myself when next fate tries to
take its cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Stormshadow mused. &ldquo;The fear has at
last penetrated as far as Overlook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bickering resumed, but without heart. Four minds rotated
toward thwarting that doom from the north.</p>
