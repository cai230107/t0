<p>Croaker let everybody rest thoroughly before he launched what he
hoped would be the final assault on the Shadowlander defenses. I
had an ague or maybe something I picked up from the proximity of
Kina for a while, hot sweats alternating with cold shakes.
Consequently I did not get out to scout our enemies.</p>

<p>No matter. The Old Man was able to gossip with his crows.</p>

<p>There were no living Shadowlanders anywhere in the defensive
works that Longshadow had deemed so critical. While we were being
soft, sitting around on our behinds resting, Mogaba and his
captains had gotten their soldiers moving. They had even tried to
destroy the stores they could not drag with them but were
forestalled in that by the efforts of an alert Shadar cavalry
detachment.</p>

<p><em>Death is eternity. Eternity is stone. Stone is silence. Stone is
broken.</em></p>

<p><em>In the night, when the wind no longer moans and the small
shadows go into hiding, stone sometimes whispers. Stone sometimes
speaks. Stone sometimes sends its children plunging into the abyss.
Sometimes a tendril of colorful mist rises to caress the figure
pinned to the tilting throne.</em></p>

<p><em>Shadows scamper playfully about the plain glittering in the
moonlight, devouring one another and growing stronger. Their
memories are as old as stone. They remember freedom.</em></p>

<p><em>Sometimes the leaning throne slips a millionth of an inch,
tilting farther. This happens more and more frequently now.</em></p>

<p><em>Stone shudders. Eternity sneers as it devours its own tail. This
cold feast is almost finished.</em></p>

<p><em>Even death is restless.</em></p>
