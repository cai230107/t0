<h2 class="chapter">27</h2>

<p>I did not have to make the trip the hard way. Not long after I
found the river my whole universe began to rock. After its third
unnatural shaking I began to feel pain. Twice more and I went into
darkness, passed through, and came up to awareness inside
One-Eye&rsquo;s wagon. The little shit was holding me up by the
shirt and slapping me while he growled something about waking my
ass up.</p>

<p>I was sitting up beside Smoke when I opened my eyes. I was
soaked with sweat. I was shaking.</p>

<p>One-Eye demanded, &ldquo;What the hell is the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Soulcatcher, I think. It was sort of
like when I used to fall through time to Dejagore. Only I kind of
squirted like a sugarmelon seed, right off to somewhere in the
delta. I knew what was happening but I couldn&rsquo;t control it.
In a way it was like walking with the ghost. But I couldn&rsquo;t
see very far&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; I realized I was
babbling, in Taglian yet. I managed to bite down on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it later. I&rsquo;ve got work to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to talk, go see Croaker. Or do whatever else you
want. But get out of the way. I&rsquo;m not kidding about the
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angry, I clambered out of the wagon. It was daytime out there,
just as it had been in the swamp. There was a lot of smoke. There
was plenty of noise from the front, where the situation seemed to
be static. There was not much chance the Old Man would take time
out to hear about my misadventure. It did not affect what was
happening right now.</p>

<p>I went over to the campfire. It had gone out. In fact, it had
gone cold.</p>

<p>Where were Thai Dei and his mother? Where was Uncle Doj?</p>

<p>Not here.</p>

<p>I found water and drank, wondering how long it would be before
the water supply became as critical as the food. I napped.
Eventually One-Eye completed his business. He came out and sat
beside me. &ldquo;Now tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have learned something important this time,
Kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know after I talk to
Croaker.&rdquo;</p>
