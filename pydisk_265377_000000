<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_7"></a><b>-7-</b></h1>
<a id="p609" name="p609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(609)">"Where do you take us? This is dark and smells of old evils!" Elys stood, her feet firmly planted, a little away from the opening, which was a narrow slit that Andas had just opened, thankful his memory served him so well.</p>
<a id="p610" name="p610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(610)">"Old evils," the girl repeated. "I do not go in there!"</p>
<a id="p611" name="p611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(611)">Before any of them could move, she drew out of reach, flitting across the bare room into which Andas had guided them, her form alternately revealed in the moonlight through the windows and hidden in the shadows between.</p>
<a id="p612" name="p612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(612)">"Elys!" He would have taken off after her. Yolyos caught his arm.</p>
<a id="p613" name="p613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(613)">"Leave her to me." The Salariki's voice was the throat rumble of a hunting feline. "I will see to her. There are other hiding places here beside your hidden ways. And the sooner you learn what rights you may have, the better. I shall watch Elys and Grasty. Return here when you can."</p>
<a id="p614" name="p614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(614)">Andas wanted nothing more than to do as Yolyos urged, yet he felt a responsibility for the others. And when he did not move, the Salariki gave him a push.</p>
<a id="p615" name="p615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(615)">"Go! I swear by the Black Fangs of the Red Gorp of Spal, I shall see to them."</p>
<a id="p616" name="p616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(616)">With an inward sigh of relief, Andas surrendered. But before he left, he made sure that the other understood how to open the door panel. Then if danger threatened, he could, with his charges, take to the hidden ways. Andas went in, the panels slipped into place, and he was in the dark.</p>
<a id="p617" name="p617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(617)">Always before he had carried a torch. But there had been times when, under his father's instructions, he had snapped it off and learned to advance a few steps at a time, trying to train other senses to serve him. One developed a guide sense through practice. And this part of the ruins held no unpleasant surprises.</p>
<a id="p618" name="p618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(618)">Still he advanced with extreme caution, one hand running fingertips along the surface of the wall. Three side passages he passed, counting each in a whisper. At the fourth he turned into the new way. He should be passing now from the long deserted portion of the palace that had been erected at Asaph's orders, approaching the section in general use in his time.</p>
<a id="p619" name="p619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(619)">In his time? How far back was that? But he must not think of that now. It could even be that while in prison their memories had been tampered with to confuse the issue should they, as they had, escape.</p>
<a id="p620" name="p620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(620)">Far ahead he saw a very faint spot of light. Toward that Andas crept, fighting down his desire to rush heedlessly to that spy hole. He sniffed. There was a scent here now, one strong enough to battle the dank smell of the ways. Flowers?</p>
<a id="p621" name="p621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(621)">He reached the spy hole and flattened himself to the wall to get the widest view possible of what lay beyond. It was easy to see where that scent came from. This was a bedchamber, and the floor had an overcarpeting of scented flowers and herbs fresh laid. Also the handles of several spice warmers protruded from under the bedcovers, which had been drawn up over them to contain their scented vapors.</p>
<a id="p622" name="p622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(622)">By twisting and turning against the wall, Andas was able to get a partial view of the rest of the room's splendors. The ceiling, of which he could see only a palm's breadth, was studded with golden stars against the pale green that was Inyanga's sky tint on the fairest of days, while the floor under the herbs and flowers was a mosaic of bright color. The lower part of the wall was also a jeweled mosaic, and he focused on that. There was a line of figures in that company, all wearing dress of state. He could see four, and there was an empty space beyond the last of those as if the mural was not yet complete.</p>
<a id="p623" name="p623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(623)">But there was no mistaking the robed and crowned man he faced the most directly. His grandfather's harshly carven features were set in the impersonal stare that was the formal "face" worn at audiences. And next to him was another&#151;two others.</p>
<a id="p624" name="p624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(624)">Standing on equality with the Emperor Akrama was another wearing the state diadem and robe, plainly his successor. Successor! But Akrama&#151;dead! Andas's teeth closed painfully upon his lower lip.</p>
<a id="p625" name="p625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(625)">If there was a new emperor&#151;who? The face in the mosaic was familiar&#151;he must know him&#151;but it was not that of Anakue, Jassar, or Yuor. He could not set name to him.</p>
<a id="p626" name="p626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(626)">A little beyond and lower than that unknown was the third portrait, this of a girl, plainly one of the Wearers of the Purple, undoubtedly a First Daughter. But her face was strange to Andas.</p>
<a id="p627" name="p627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(627)">There was no one in the room, he could see, and he was fumbling for the release of the panel door on this side when he heard voices. The great empear shell and silver door opened, and two women, wearing the green and white of ladies of the inner chambers, backed into the room, bowing low before a third.</p>
<a id="p628" name="p628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(628)">The newcomer was the woman whose face was pictured on the wall, save that it was not now set in the awesome, stiff pose demanded by Imperial art. She looked much younger and more human than her portrait. Her hair, like that of her attendants, was completely hidden beneath a tall, bejeweled diadem from which fine chains depended to take some of the weight of massive earrings. Her robe was of the Imperial purple much overlaid with jeweled embroidery until it made such a stiff encasing for her body that she moved very slowly under its weight.</p>
<a id="p629" name="p629"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(629)">Involuntarily Andas's shoulders twitched. He remembered only too well the weight of such garments and the way they plagued one through the long hours of some ultra-boring court ceremony. She must be glad to be in her inner chamber, able to free herself of that regalia.</p>
<a id="p630" name="p630"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(630)">She stood statue-like, stiff as her portrait, as the two ladies struggled with clasps and ties until they could bear away that robe. In her soft undergarment she looked again younger. And she continued to wait patiently as they bestowed the robe somewhere beyond Andas's line of vision and returned to take her crown. Then she raised her hands to her head and stripped off with a quick pull the tight net that had bound down her hair, allowing its wiry, curling lengths to puff up from her skull.</p>
<a id="p631" name="p631"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(631)">With the overshadowing of the crown gone, Andas could better see her features. She was no real beauty, yet there was that about her that drew a man's eyes.</p>
<a id="p632" name="p632"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(632)">"The Presence wishes&#151;?" One of the ladies fell upon her knees, holding out a tray bearing a crystal goblet filled with a pale pink frothy drink.</p>
<a id="p633" name="p633"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(633)">The girl shook her head. "I have supped, I have drunk, past the point of feeling comfortable. One eats to forget the speeches of those who have nothing to say but recite it in a never-ending circling&#151;" She stretched her arms wide. "Duse of the Golden Lips, how those trappings wear upon one! I think that some day when they are taken off, there will be nothing left of me but bare bone. You may go, Jacamada. Wait a little before you send my night maids. I need a moment to rest&#151;"</p>
<a id="p634" name="p634"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(634)">"As the Presence wishes, so shall it be," intoned the lady.</p>
<a id="p635" name="p635"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(635)">Andas moved impatiently. How it all came back&#151;this smothering life of the Triple Towers! One might speak freely&#151;a little&#151;as this princess had just done. But the answers from all&#151;save a tiny number of equal rank&#151;would never be more than the formalities frozen into a set court speech by centuries of custom. Soon he would have no more freedom, perhaps even less than she whom he watched.</p>
<a id="p636" name="p636"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(636)">If this chamber was that of one of the Imperial princesses, he must now be on the outskirts of the Flower Courts. Yet his memories of the inner ways could not be that far wrong. This section of rooms had not been in use before. They were&#151;he probed memory&#151;yes, this was the court of Empress Alaha, who had been first wife to Emperor Amurak a hundred years ago.</p>
<a id="p637" name="p637"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(637)">Empress? No, the lady had addressed her as "Presence," which was not a ruler's title. It was safer to assume she was First Daughter. He was trying to imagine their relationship when he saw that she was staring at the panel behind which he stood.</p>
<a id="p638" name="p638"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(638)">"Creeper&#151;spy!" Her voice was cutting with its cold anger. "Carry what tales you will, but remember two can play at this game. And remember this also&#151;I have a way of knowing when you watch me. It is one beyond your discernment since it comes from the hands of the Voice of the Old Woman of Bones!"</p>
<a id="p639" name="p639"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(639)">Andas's astonishment for a moment was true awe. Then the last name made the chill of fear touch him like a hand of ice reaching into this stuffy confinement.</p>
<a id="p640" name="p640"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(640)">Old Woman of Bones&#151;but how had a First Daughter in the heart of the guarded Triple Towers had recourse to the Old Woman? Unless&#151;dark rumors of old, stories that had been many times told within these walls, flowed from his memory. The Flower Courts had their own intrigues, and sometimes death had stalked there more ruthlessly even than in the Emperors dungeons.</p>
<a id="p641" name="p641"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(641)">She raised her hand, drawing from the forefolds of her robe a chain on which slid a ring. This she was about to put on her finger, while her lips curved in a small, secret smile.</p>
<a id="p642" name="p642"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(642)">"I do not think," she said, and the threat in her voice was open, "that you will return to your mistress with the same joy in life with which you left her&#151;"</p>
<a id="p643" name="p643"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(643)">Because those old stories had a more potent influence on him than he would have believed, had it not been put to the test, Andas found the catch of the panel and watched the narrow slit open. He leaped out, his hands ready as if to meet an enemy.</p>
<a id="p644" name="p644"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(644)">He must prevent her using that ring, as the old tales said it could be used. She already had it halfway to her mouth. Let her breathe on it, activate it&#151;</p>
<a id="p645" name="p645"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(645)">But she stared at him almost wildly, her gesture not completed. He was able to reach her, imprison her wrist, and twist it behind her back, using his other hand to cover her mouth lest she bring in guards with a scream.</p>
<a id="p646" name="p646"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(646)">She fought him, but he was able to pull her closer to the passage door. Now he released her hand long enough to grab at the ring. It was a tight fit on her finger, and he could not get it free as she battled him. Once more he tightened his hold until she could only get her breath in half-sobbing gasps.</p>
<a id="p647" name="p647"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(647)">For a moment he held her so; then she spoke.</p>
<a id="p648" name="p648"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(648)">"You have doomed yourself to the ultimate death, laying hands upon the person of the First Daughter." Her voice was calm, almost too calm after the violence of her fight seconds earlier.</p>
<a id="p649" name="p649"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(649)">"I think not." He spoke for the first time. "Look to your own safety, First Daughter, for you would have loosed the power of the Bones against the Chosen of the High Throne."</p>
<a id="p650" name="p650"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(650)">She laughed. "Your wits are gone, skulker in the dark. There is no Chosen prince. I can say that in truth. I am First Daughter, without a brother, to whom my father, the Emperor, has promised the throne to share with a husband of our mutual choosing."</p>
<a id="p651" name="p651"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(651)">"And what is the Emperor's name," Andas asked then.</p>
<a id="p652" name="p652"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(652)">She looked puzzled, but she had regained her composure. When she spoke, it was not to answer his question, but as if some other subject were far more vital.</p>
<a id="p653" name="p653"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(653)">"I do not think that Angcela sent you." She looked to the ring. "No, I have strengthened the warning with her blood and hair, she not knowing. She is not behind your coming. So, who are you&#151;and why do you creep secretly so?"</p>
<a id="p654" name="p654"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(654)">"I asked you"&#151;Andas shook her, hoping thus to establish some authority over her long enough to get straight answers&#151;"Who is the Emperor?"</p>
<a id="p655" name="p655"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(655)">"Andas, son of Asalin, of the House of Kastor." She studied his face, frowning. Then she asked, "My father was in Pav in his youth, but for the rest of his years he has been ever in the Triple Towers. He took no full wife before my mother, nor was it ever known&#151;and you cannot long keep such a secret in the Flower Courts&#151;that he ever made a lesser choice. Yet, you might be my father in his youth. Are you some secretly gotten son of his?" And her eyes blazed with what he was sure was pure hate.</p>
<a id="p656" name="p656"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(656)">"I am myself, Andas, son of Asalin." He wondered if he could convince her, and beyond her the others, that another man ruled without right. But, she was the <i>daughter </i>of this false Andas! How long then&#151;Once more he shook her.</p>
<a id="p657" name="p657"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(657)">"The year&#151;in galactic reckoning&#151;what is the year?"</p>
<a id="p658" name="p658"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(658)">"It is 2275."</p>
<a id="p659" name="p659"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(659)">"Forty-five years&#151;" he said, and without his realizing it, he loosed his hold. She, ready for such a chance, tore out of his hands. But he caught her quickly again.</p>
<a id="p660" name="p660"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(660)">"I do not know what you mean. If you are some ill-got son, you have no claim on the Emperor or the throne," she spat at him.</p>
<a id="p661" name="p661"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(661)">"There is no true emperor on the throne," he got out, hardly believing it himself&#151;though it must be true, for here he was, and he did not doubt that she was telling him the truth. In other words, she was the daughter of the android who had taken his place. But could an android father children? He had no idea&#151;many secrets could be hidden by the Emperor's will. She might be a substitute brought in to bolster up the other's claim to humanity.</p>
<a id="p662" name="p662"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(662)">"You are mad&#151;totally mad!" She had lost most of her assurance and began to struggle again.</p>
<a id="p663" name="p663"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(663)">"There is no Emperor Andas because I am Andas&#151;kidnaped and hidden."</p>
<a id="p664" name="p664"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(664)">Her mouth twisted. "Have you looked into a mirror? You are a youth. My father is a man who has already had one renew-life injection. Do you think he could have deceived the medics then? You are the android&#151;and mad in the bargain! Though the ring does not warn me, this must be some trick of Angcela's. She wants the crown so much that it has become food and drink, and she will die without it! But in you she has an imperfect tool."</p>
<a id="p665" name="p665"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(665)">Andas hardly heard her. The court intrigues she mouthed about meant nothing. What did was that long tale of years he could not account for&#151;the fact that here on Inyanga an Andas sat in power&#151;an emperor who was&#151;who <i>must </i>be&#151;an android! Yet, had the stass at the prison kept him young? And if the Emperor had had an age-arrest injection, why the medics should know they were dealing with an android&#151;</p>
<a id="p666" name="p666"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(666)">"I am not," he said dully.</p>
<a id="p667" name="p667"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(667)">He did not see the spark flare in her eyes. She watched him now with a small cruel smile, like that she had worn earlier when she had detected him in hiding.</p>
<a id="p668" name="p668"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(668)">"Do you still doubt it? Come then, prove it! Look into the mirror yonder and tell me truly that you are an aging man. Come!"</p>
<a id="p669" name="p669"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(669)">She pulled at him, and hardly knowing why, he came with her to stand before a tall mirror, which reflected all before it with pitiless clarity.</p>
<a id="p670" name="p670"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(670)">There he stood, not quite as he had seen himself in the past, for the torn and stained coverall was far different from the clothes he had last worn when he looked at himself so. But he was as he had always been, his brown face thin, with the high bridged nose of the royal clans, his hair springing on his head like a dusky halo, dark eyes, teeth that shone the whiter against his skin. On his forehead was the delicate tattoo of the Imperial house&#151;the Serpent of Dambo, a crown he could never erase in his lifetime.</p>
<a id="p671" name="p671"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(671)">She stood close beside him, for he still had wit enough to hold her beringed hand. And in this mirror she was a slighter, more fragile copy of himself. She could have been his sister, the relationship closely marked&#151;he had to admit that. Though with the royal clans so intermated in the past, such a resemblance could well exist. Only, she was the Emperor's daughter&#151;that he was forced to accept. The daughter of an emperor <i>Andas </i>who was not he.</p>
<a id="p672" name="p672"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(672)">He could see her in the mirror as plainly as he saw himself. She had lost that teasing smile that promised ill. In fact, she had changed somewhat.</p>
<a id="p673" name="p673"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(673)">"You&#151;you are like my father in the tri-dees taken of his coronation. You are like&#151;too like! What sorcery has Angcela brought into being?"</p>
<a id="p674" name="p674"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(674)">She tugged to free her hand and bent her head to raise that ominous ring to her lips. But he held it to him so he could see it the better. The setting was a round stone with a heart of coiling light. Then the light changed and made a shadow face, which grew stronger, sharper.</p>
<a id="p675" name="p675"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(675)">"Anakue!" He hailed that tiny portrait.</p>
<a id="p676" name="p676"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(676)">The girl stared at him as if she were frightened at last.</p>
<a id="p677" name="p677"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(677)">"Anakue the traitor! But&#151;how comes he? I did not summon&#151;and he was long dead before my birthing."</p>
<a id="p678" name="p678"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(678)">"When did he die?"</p>
<a id="p679" name="p679"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(679)">She still stared at the ring and did not answer.</p>
<a id="p680" name="p680"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(680)">"I said," Andas demanded sharply, "when did he die?"</p>
<a id="p681" name="p681"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(681)">"When&#151;when my father was made Chosen. He tried to kill him. There was much trouble, and Anakue and several of the nobles were executed. My father, he uncovered the plot, and Anakue tried to claim that he wanted to kill the Emperor. But no one believed that, for my father could prove his loyalty."</p>
<a id="p682" name="p682"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(682)">The planted android&#151;had Anakue been behind that? But if <i>he </i>were the android&#151;Andas shook his head. It was like being caught in a fog.</p>
<a id="p683" name="p683"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(683)">"Why did he show in the ring?" the girl continued. "I did not summon him! Was it because you held my hand and looked within? But the ring was not sealed to you! I saw Rixissa draw it from the fire heart, and she sealed it to me only. And you are a man, so cannot serve the Old Woman more than as a slave."</p>
<a id="p684" name="p684"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(684)">"Which you would have made me, had I let you," he said grimly. "Now&#151;what is your name?"</p>
<a id="p685" name="p685"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(685)">"Abena, as you must well know. Yes, I would have in-tied you with the ring. It warned me that I was spied upon. I could have made you my tool against Angcela."</p>
<a id="p686" name="p686"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(686)">"I do not know who this Angcela is, and I am no servant of hers. What I am&#151;well, that I must prove. And, Abena, this is now necessary."</p>
<a id="p687" name="p687"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(687)">His free hand rose and pressed a spot in her throat. She had no time for protest, and he caught her before she slipped to the floor. He brought her to the bed, turned back the covers, and pulled out the spicers, laying her in their place. And he lingered long enough to work that ring from her finger. He could not take her with him through the runways, but he made sure of her strongest weapon against him.</p>
<a id="p688" name="p688"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(688)">There was one way of proving, at least to himself, that he was who he claimed to be. If he were not of the authentic blood, or if he had not undergone, before his grandfather's eyes, the first of the Three Ceremonies, he could not hope to lay hands upon what he now sought. But the very fact that he could find it, hold it, would be an argument to prove his tale.</p>
<a id="p689" name="p689"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(689)">But, now he needed light. Fearing any moment to hear the scratch of a maid's warn stick on the door, he toured the room, finding what he sought in one of the window seats. They were deep enough to provide a slender set of shelves against the frames, enough to hold tri-dee tapes. And there was a small porto light there also, clumsy for a hand torch but usable.</p>
<a id="p690" name="p690"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(690)">Andas had sealed the ring into a seam pocket of his coverall. Nobody was going to see it much longer. There were a couple of wells down which it could be sent to oblivion. He paused for a moment by the bed. As she lay there, the princess looked very young and innocent. Yet the fact that she knew how to use the ring meant she had ability to draw on deep and dark knowledge that most men loathed and few women had courage to claim for their own.</p>
<a id="p691" name="p691"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(691)">Andas got back into the hidden passage and snapped the panel shut behind him. He might have a very limited time to reach what he sought&#151;so the sooner he was on his way, the better. So far he had come by a roundabout way. Now he must seize the chance on a passage that led into the heart of the Towers&#151;the private quarters of the Emperor. And there was no telling about the ways there&#151;maybe the Emperor knew them.</p>
<a id="p692" name="p692"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(692)">He switched the lamp on low. If the Emperor was the android, then he must have been provided with Andas's memories&#151;which meant that he would know all about the exploration of these ways in the old days. So he would be prepared, once he had heard Abena's story, to hunt Andas through the very passages he had confidently trusted to hide him. He could even set up ambushes!</p>
<a id="p693" name="p693"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(693)">The only deterrent to the android against putting the guard in the passages as hunting hounds would be that too many secrets would be so revealed. But what that might mean in the future had no bearing on the present. Andas had to find the Emperor's chamber as soon as he could, and he only hoped that his memory was correct.</p>
<a id="p694" name="p694"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(694)">He began to count side passages, three, four&#151;it was the sixth one that he wanted. Yes, it was here, five almost wall to wall with six. That gave onto a flight of stairs where dampness oozed. And there was a dank smell of&#151;what had Elys called it&#151;evil! Yes, if evil had a smell of its own, this was where one could well find it. There had been death walking these narrow ways through the centuries before him.</p>
<a id="p695" name="p695"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(695)">Andas counted twenty steps, and then the passage leveled off. But there were slime tracks on the walls here. They glistened in the lamplight. He never remembered seeing any of the things that left such traces, nor did he want to. But he dared now to turn the lamp up full strength to shine ahead.</p>
<a id="p696" name="p696"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(696)">The pavement under foot was crossed and recrossed by thicker trails of slime. He slowed his pace a little as his sandals slipped and slid. If he remembered rightly, this was the worst section of the way, for it ran under the moat pond that surrounded the Emperor's pavilion.</p>
<a id="p697" name="p697"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(697)">Steps ahead, going up now. He turned the lamp back to low and climbed. It was like progressing out of the foul air of a swamp, for here the walls were drier, and now and then there was actually a whiff of incense or herbs wafting through the spy holes along this passage. But Andas did not pause at any of those holes. Time was important, and what he sought was at the very end of this way.</p>
