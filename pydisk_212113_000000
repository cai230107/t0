<h2 class="chapter">75</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Talk to me,&rdquo; I told the runt wizards.</p>

<p>Goblin said,
&ldquo;We think something was done to you when you were out
there.&rdquo; He jerked his head shoreward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Get serious!
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are. You were gone a long time. And you changed. How
many disappearing spells have you had since you got
back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave it an honest think. &ldquo;Only one. Maybe. When I was
kidnapped. I don&rsquo;t remember anything about it. I&rsquo;m sure
they drugged me. I was drinking tea with the Speaker, then I was in
that street where you found me. I have no idea how I got there. I
have vague recollections of smelling smoke and going out a door
which put me somewhere that I did not expect to be when I got to
the other side. I vaguely remember thinking something about being
in the house of pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tortured you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did.&rdquo; I still had the nicks and bruises to
prove it. I had no idea what I might have been asked, if anything.
I did suspect that Sindhu&rsquo;s pals were behind my abduction and
the attempt on Mogaba.</p>

<p>If so, their life sure took an unpleasant turn when the Black
Company found them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching you,&rdquo; Goblin said.
&ldquo;And you have been behaving pretty strange sometimes. What we
want to do is put you to sleep and see if we can&rsquo;t reach the
part of you that was there when things happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to. You just have to
cooperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not sound sure.</p>

<p>I awakened on my own pallet. Not refreshed. Someone was wiping
my hot face with a cold, wet cloth. I opened my eyes. In the light
of one tiny candle Sahra looked more lovely than ever. She looked
better than imagination. She continued to wipe my face.</p>

<p>I had another hangover type headache. What had they done? I
ought at least to get the enjoyment that came before the pain.</p>

<p>To Tan began to fuss. He slept in a basket of evil smelling rags
beneath my writing table. I reached over and took his hand. He
stopped crying, content to have human contact. He did not cry for
his mother much anymore.</p>

<p>I raised my other hand to take Sahra&rsquo;s. She pushed it back
gently. She never spoke. I never did hear her speak, not even to
her own children.</p>

<p>I looked around. Thai Dei was gone. Anymore it seemed I had a
better chance of shaking my shadow. Thai Dei was there even in the
dark.</p>

<p>I started to sit up. Sahra held me down with two fingers. I was
too weak to do anything. And my head felt like it doubled in size
just rising that foot.</p>

<p>Sahra offered me a hand-carved wooden cup filled with something
that smelled so foul my eyes watered. Nyueng Bao swamp medicine. I
drank. It tasted worse than it smelled.</p>

<p>She continued to mop my face. I shivered and shook. The pain
went away. I began to relax, to feel both energetic and positive.
That was good stuff. Maybe they made it smell and taste bad so
people would not take it all the time.</p>

<p>We stared at one another a long time, saying nothing but
reaching a decision our conscious minds did not entirely recognize
at the moment. Hong Tray drifted across my thoughts with a smile
and an admonition.</p>

<p>This time I managed a smile when I sat up. Unchallenged.
&ldquo;I have work to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sahra shook her head. She fished under the table for To Tan, dug
him out of his basket. He was in desperate need of changing. Sahra
tugged my finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done this in twenty years.&rdquo; Not
since I was a kid myself and had baby brothers and sisters and
cousins to change. &ldquo;Stop wiggling, you little turd. You ought
to know the drill by now.&rdquo; To Tan looked back at me with
serious big eyes, not understanding my words but catching my
tone.</p>

<p>We got him cleaned up and clothed again, in rags that would have
embarrassed a beggar. I told Sahra, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go kill
somebody, get him something better to wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid a hand lightly on my forearm, restraining me.
&ldquo;That was a joke, hon. You hang around with me, you&rsquo;re
going to hear some dark stuff. I don&rsquo;t mean it literally.
I&rsquo;m going to work now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I moved into the passageway slowly, my legs watery. Sahra
followed, To Tan straddling her left hip. We ran into Bucket right
away, looking groggy as he headed for his own pallet. I asked,
&ldquo;You seen Goblin and One-Eye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went upstairs with their magic junk. To the big
lookout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we walked five feet, Bucket called, &ldquo;Longo tell you
the water is coming up in the catacombs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sighed and shook my head, listened to the half-hearted rumble
of my stomach, wondered if anybody had found a way to get some food
cooked, wound my way through the maze to the ladders that would
take me up to Goblin and One-Eye.</p>

<p>The light of day might do me good. If I had the strength to
climb that far. I had not seen the sun for a long time.</p>
