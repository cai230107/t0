<h2 class="chapter">II</h2>

<p>It was weird that nobody else thought of it right away. But
maybe that was because people were more taken with what had
happened between the Lady and the White Rose and were wondering
what that would mean to the empire and the rebellion. For a while
it looked like half the world was up for grabs. Everybody who was
the sort to do some grabbing was eyeballing his or her chances and
scouting around to see if they might get turned into eunuchs if
they tried.</p>

<p>So it was up to some second-rate hustlers from Oar&rsquo;s north
side to take first whack at stealing the silver spike.</p>

<p>The news from the Barrowland was still in the shithouse rumor
stage when Tully Stahl came pounding on the door of the room where
his cousin Smeds Stahl stayed.</p>

<p>The room Smeds lived in had no furnishings except roaches and
dirt, half a dozen mildewed, stolen blankets, and half a gross of
empty clay wine jugs that he never got around to taking back. They
made him pay deposit at the Thorn and Crown. Smeds called the jugs
his life savings. If times got really tough he could trade eight
empties for a full.</p>

<p>Tully said that was a dumb way to do things. Whenever Smeds got
ripped and pissed he started throwing things around. He wasted his
savings.</p>

<p>The shards never got picked up, either, just kicked against one
wall, where they formed a dusty badland.</p>

<p>When Tully got on him Smeds figured he was just putting on airs
because he was flush. Tully had two married women giving him
presents for helping out around the house when the old man was
gone. And he was living with a widow he was going to clean out as
soon as he found some other woman to take him in. He thought being
a success gave him the right to dish out advice.</p>

<p>Tully pounded on the door. Smeds ignored him. The Kinbro girls
from upstairs, Marti and Sheena, eleven and twelve, were there for
their &ldquo;music lessons.&rdquo; The three of them were naked and
tumbling around on the ratty blankets. The only instrument in sight
was a skin flute.</p>

<p>Smeds made the girls stop bouncing and giggling. There was
people who wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate how he was preparing them for
later life.</p>

<p>Pound. Pound. Pound. &ldquo;Come on, Smeds. Open up. It&rsquo;s me. Tully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open up. I got a deal I got to talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, Smeds untangled himself from skinny young limbs and
trudged to the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my cousin. He&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls had been into the wine. They didn&rsquo;t care. They
didn&rsquo;t cover themselves. They just sat there grinning when
Smeds let Tully in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some friends,&rdquo; Smeds explained. &ldquo;You want in?
They don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some other time. Get them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds glared at his cousin. Getting too damned pushy.
&ldquo;Come on, girls. Get your clothes on. Papa has to talk
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tully and Smeds watched while they got into ragged clothing. It
didn&rsquo;t occur to Smeds to dress. Sheena gave old Hank the
Shank a playful slap as she went by. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;
The door closed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get your ass in a
sling,&rdquo; Tully said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than you. You ought to meet their
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She got any money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But she blows a mean horn. Got a thing about it. She
gets going she just can&rsquo;t quit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you going to clean this pigsty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon as the maid gets back from holiday. So what&rsquo;s
so important you have to break in on my party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard about what happened up in the
Barrowland?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard some stories. I didn&rsquo;t pay no attention.
What do I care? Won&rsquo;t make no difference to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might. You hear the part about the silver
spike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds thought. &ldquo;Yeah. They stuck it in a tree. I thought
that would be handy to glom on to. Then I thought some more and
figured there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough silver in it to make it
worth the trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the silver, cousin. It&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s in the silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds turned it around in his mind some. He couldn&rsquo;t find
Tully&rsquo;s angle. &ldquo;You better lay it out by the
numbers.&rdquo; Smeds Stahl was not known for his keen mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That big nail has the soul of the Dominator trapped in
it. That means it&rsquo;s one bad hunk of metal. You take some big
wazoo of a sorcerer, I bet he could pound it into some kind of
all-time mean amulet. You know, like in stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds frowned. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t sorcerers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tully got impatient. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be the middlemen. We go
up there and dig it out of that tree and hide it out till word gets
around that it&rsquo;s gone. Then we let it out that it&rsquo;s for
sale. To the highest bidder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds frowned some more and put his whole brain to work. He was
no genius but he had plenty of low, mean cunning and he had learned
how to stay alive. &ldquo;Sounds damned dangerous to me. Something
we&rsquo;d need help on if we wanted to come out of it in one
piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. Even the easy part, going up there and liberating
the damned thing, would be more than a two-man job. The Great
Forest might be a pretty rough place for guys who don&rsquo;t know
anything about the woods. I figured we&rsquo;d need two more guys,
one of them who knows about the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already we&rsquo;re talking a four-way split here, Tully.
On how much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Give them time to bid it up, I think
we&rsquo;d be set for life. And I ain&rsquo;t talking no four-way
split, neither, Smeds. Two ways. All in the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at each other. Smeds said, &ldquo;You got the plan.
Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Timmy Locan? Was in the army for a
while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About long enough to figure out how to go over the hill.
Yeah. He&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in long enough to learn how it works. We might run
into soldiers up there. Would your heart be broken if they found
him in an alley with his head bashed in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was an easy one. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; His heart would be fine
as long as it wasn&rsquo;t Smeds Stahl they found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Old Man Fish? He used to trap in the Great
Forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couple of straight arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we need. Honest crooks. Not some guys
who might try to do us out of our share. What do you say? Want to
go for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me how much is in it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough to live like princes. We going to go talk to those
guys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smeds shrugged. &ldquo;Why not? What have I got better to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the ceiling. &ldquo;You better get some
clothes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heading down the stairs, Smeds said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
do the talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heading up the street, Smeds asked, &ldquo;You ever killed
anybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I never needed to. I don&rsquo;t see where I&rsquo;d
have any problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to once. Cut a guy&rsquo;s throat. It ain&rsquo;t
like you think. They spray blood all over the place and make weird
noises. And they take a long time to croak. And they keep trying to
come after you. I still get nightmares about that guy trying to
take me with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tully looked at him and made a face. &ldquo;Then do it some
other way next time.&rdquo;</p>
