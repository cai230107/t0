<h2 class="chapter">6</h2>

<p>When you look down from the citadel you have to wonder how the
Jaicuri manage, all jammed inside Dejagore&rsquo;s walls. Truth is,
they don&rsquo;t and never did.</p>

<p>At one time the hills surrounding the plain were covered with
farms and orchards and vineyards. After the shadow came enterprises
gradually disappeared as the peasant families abandoned the land.
And then the antishadow, the Black Company, came, ever so hungry
after the long sprint south from the victory at Ghoja Ford. And
then came the Shadowlander armies which battered us.</p>

<p>Now the hills bear little but memories of what once was.
Vultures never picked bones much cleaner than those hills have been
gleaned.</p>

<p>The wisest peasants were those who fled early. Their children
will repopulate the land.</p>

<p>Later the stupid ones ran here, inside the false safety of
Dejagore&rsquo;s walls. When Mogaba is particularly cranky he
drives a few hundred out the gate. They are just mouths crying to
be filled. Food must be husbanded for those willing to die
defending the walls.</p>

<p>Locals who fail to contribute, or who demonstrate a weakness for
getting sick or seriously injured, go out the gate right behind the
peasants.</p>

<p>Shadowspinner won&rsquo;t take any in but those willing to help
raise his earthworks and dig his burial trenches. The former means
laboring under falls of missiles directed by old friends inside,
while the latter means making the bed where you will lie as soon as
you are useful no longer.</p>

<p>Hard choices.</p>

<p>Mogaba cannot fathom why his military genius isn&rsquo;t
universally hailed.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mess with the Nyueng Bao. Not yet. They
haven&rsquo;t contributed much to Dejagore&rsquo;s defense but they
don&rsquo;t sap resources, either. Their babies are getting fat
while the rest of us tighten our belts.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t see many dogs or cats now. Horses manage only
because they are militarily protected, and then only a handful of
them. We&rsquo;re going to eat hearty when the last fodder is
gone.</p>

<p>Small game like rats and pigeons are becoming scarce. Sometimes
you hear the outraged protest of a crow taken by surprise.</p>

<p>The Nyueng Bao are survivors.</p>

<p>They are a race possessed of a single impassive face.</p>

<p>Mogaba does not bother them mainly because when anybody does the
whole bunch gets pissed off. And they consider fighting a really
serious, holy business.</p>

<p>They stay out of the way when they can but they aren&rsquo;t
pacifists. A couple of times the Shadowlanders have regretted
trying to push through their part of town.</p>

<p>The Nyueng Bao generated an amazing amount of carnage both
times.</p>

<p>Rumor among the Jaicuri says they eat their enemies.</p>

<p>It is true, human bones showing evidence of butchery and cookery
have been found. Jaicuri are mainly of the Gunni religion. Gunni
are vegetarians.</p>

<p>I do not believe the Nyueng Bao are responsible, but Ky Dam
refuses to deny even the blackest allegation against his
people.</p>

<p>Maybe he will accept any canard that makes the Nyueng Bao seem
more dangerous. Maybe he wants that kind of talk so fear will
build.</p>

<p>Survivors grasp the tools at hand.</p>

<p>I wish they would talk. I&rsquo;d bet they could tell stories
that would curl your toes and straighten your hair.</p>

<p>Ah! Dejagore! Those halcyon days, slouching through hell with a
smile on.</p>

<p>How long before all the fun goes out of the town?</p>
