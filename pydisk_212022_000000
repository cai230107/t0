<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Forty-one: LADY</h2>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always best to be old and wise in the ways of
battlefields, Lady thought. She saw what was coming, clearly, long
before anybody else did. Briefly, after Murgen skewered the
Shadowmaster, she had hopes it would turn, but the advent of the
troops from the encampment caused a shift in momentum that could
not be reversed.</p>

<p>Croaker should not have attacked. He should have waited as long
as it took, made them come to him, not been so concerned about the
Shadowmasters. If he had allowed the new army from the south to
come forward and get in the way of the men from the encampment, he
could have then hurled his elephants in without risk to his right.
But it was too late to weep about might-have-beens. It was time to
try rooting out a miracle.</p>

<p>One Shadowmaster was out and the other was crippled. If only she
had a tenth, even a hundredth, of the power she had lost. If only
she&rsquo;d had time to nurture and channel the little bit that had
begun coming back to her.</p>

<p>If only. If only. All life was if only.</p>

<p>Where was that damned imp of One-Eye&rsquo;s? It could turn this
around. There was nobody on the other side to keep it from going
through those men like a scythe, at least for long enough.</p>

<p>But Frogface was nowhere to be seen. One-Eye and Goblin were
working as a team, doing their little bit to stem the tide.
Frogface was not with them. They seemed too busy to be curious
about that.</p>

<p>The imp&rsquo;s absence was too important to be accident or
oversight. Why? at this critical juncture?</p>

<p>No time. No time to brood about it and slither down through all
the shadows and try to find the meaning of the imp&rsquo;s
presences and absences, which had been bothering her so long. Only
time to realize, with certainty, that the creature had been planted
upon One-Eye and wasn&rsquo;t his to command at all.</p>

<p>By whom?</p>

<p>Not the Shadowmasters. The Shadowmasters would have used the imp
directly. Not Shifter. He&rsquo;d had no need. Not the Howler. He
would have gotten his revenge.</p>

<p>What else was loose in the world?</p>

<p>A crow flapped past. It cawed in a way that made her think it
was laughing.</p>

<p>Croaker and his crows. He had been muttering about crows for a
year. And then they had started turning up around him any time
anything big happened.</p>

<p>She glanced at the mound where Croaker and Murgen had set the
standard. Croaker had a pair of crows perched on his shoulders. A
flock circled above him. He made a dramatic figure there in his
Widowmaker disguise, with the doombirds wheeling around him, waving
his fiery sword, trying to rally his crumbling legions.</p>

<p>While the mind pursued one clatch of enemies the body dealt with
another. She wielded her weapons with a dancer&rsquo;s grace and
the deadliness of a demigoddess. At first there had been an
exhilaration, realizing she was approaching a state she had not
achieved in ages, except by the path of its tantric cousin, last
night. And then she went over into the perfect calm, the mystic
separation of Self and flesh that actually melded into a greater,
more illuminated and deadly whole.</p>

<p>There was no fear in that state, nor any other emotion. It was
like being in the deepest meditation, where the Self wandered a
field of glimmering insights, yet the flesh performed its deadly
tasks with a precision and perfection that left the dead mounded
about her and her terrible mount.</p>

<p>The enemy wrestled with one another to stay away from her. Her
allies fought to get into the safety of the vacuum surrounding her.
Though the right wing had begun to collapse, one stubborn rock
formed.</p>

<p>The Self reflected on memories of illuminations won during the
night from a pair of bodies, sweating, straining together, on her
absolute amazement during and after. Her life had been one of
absolute self-control. Yet time and again the flesh had gone beyond
any hope of control. At her age.</p>

<p>And she looked at Croaker again, now harried by his enemies.</p>

<p>And the shadow crept into the killing perfection and showed her
why she had denied herself for so long.</p>

<p>She thought of loss.</p>

<p>And loss mattered.</p>

<p>Mattering intruded upon the Self, distracting it. It wanted to
take control of the flesh, to force things to transpire according
to its desires.</p>

<p>She started forcing her way toward Croaker, the knot of men
around her moving with her. But the enemy could sense that she was
no longer the terrible thing she had been, that she was now
vulnerable. They pressed in. One by one, her companions fell.</p>

<p>Then she saw the arrow strike Croaker and drop him at the foot
of the standard. She shrieked and spurred her mount over friend and
foe alike.</p>

<p>Her pain, and her rage, only carried her into a mass of enemies
who attacked from every direction. She cut some, but others dragged
her off her rearing steed and harried the beast away. She fought
with skill and desperation against poorly trained opponents, but
the ineptness of her enemies was not enough. She heaped bodies,
but they drove her down to her
knees&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A wave of chaos swept over that fight within the battle, men
fleeing, men pursuing, and when it passed all that could be seen of
her was one arm protruding from a pile of corpses.</p>
