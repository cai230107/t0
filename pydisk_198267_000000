             "I just hope I'm still Queen of Dularn when you return," Ma-
        ris  said as we made our good byes there at the dock,  the  great 
        bulk of the Diana there behind us like some strange sea  monster.  
        The Senate had not thought much of Maris' agreement to assist the 
        Empire in its war against Mexico.  I suspected that most of  them 
        did not understand the "realities of power" that existed now.   I 
        supposed I couldn't really "blame" them too much either.  For the 
        time  being we possessed the one "ultimate weapon" against  which 
        there was no practical defense in the Diana.  It was true that we 
        would not possess this "advantage" over the Empire for long, as I 
        knew  there was already a second Imperial battleship  under  con-
        struction  there in Trella to replace the one Tara's agent  sank.  
        I  had watched Darlanis board the Arsana to Trella  clipper  that 
        now ran between our two countries, a bit of "hope" for peace now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We're doing the `right' thing," I said, Carol nodding.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It shouldn't take us that long," my wife added then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'll keep things `safe' for you," Maris promised.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             There was no cheering this time when we left Dularn.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm glad you're here," I said to Carol, Sandra standing  by 
        the helmsman, the steady regular "thud-thud" of the Diana's three 
        engines such a "familiar" sound that I hardly noticed it anymore.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Hope  should be all right with Kathi and that  `wet  nurse' 
        that  Maris found for her," my brownette answered, my  arm  about 
        her  firm feminine body as she stood at my side, her ornate  uni-
        form as Warlady of Dularn seeming "fitting" now after everything.  
        I knew if neither of us came back that Maris would act as  Hope's 
        mother until she became of age, such being in the "will" that  we 
        had signed.  Such is commonplace in this era, as has been  noted.  
        I  was somewhat surprised that Carol would leave Hope right  now, 
        but my wife is not a woman who is extremely "maternal" anyway...*
        
        * Perhaps "that" is "why" we left Hope with Maris when we decided 
        to return to our own time as I've written at the end of this...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We'll  be back before the first snow," I smiled, seeing  my 
        wife's hazel eyes meet mine.  Ahead of us laid a voyage far long-
        er  than any the Diana had ever undertaken before, a distance  of 
        two  thousand  miles down the coastline of North America  to  the 
        Gulf of California.  Ten days sailing at seven and a half  knots, 
        although  the  Diana did not have the "range" to steam  that  far 
        without  "refueling", our maximum range at best being about  fif-
        teen  hundred miles.  We would refuel in Sarn, again  in  Trella, 
        and  then hopefully once again in La Paz.  I wished to  keep  our 
        coal supplies in "reserve" as much as I could, such "fuel"  being 
        more "efficient" than ordinary firewood.  Lamp oil was even "hot-
        ter" burning than coal, but its cost made it rather impractical.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Going to seem `funny' fighting on the side of the  Empire," 
        Sandra  "commented", voicing an opinion "shared" by many  aboard.  
        "Especially against a foe that's never `bothered' us," she added.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "`Ours' is not to `ask why'," Carol smiled, "But to `do'..."
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Bother you, being away from Hope like this?" I asked Carol.  
        My wife standing there looking out through the open stern hatches 
        at the boiling wake, a "hint" of wood smoke there in the cabin.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  am both a `mother' and a `wife'," Carol  answered  back.  
        "And I have been neglecting the latter `more' than I should do."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It's a `comfort' to have you here," I said to my love then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Darlanis  was  right about the  `double  standard',"  Carol 
        smiled.  "And there's no real reason for it any more either now."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  don't think you'd get too many husbands to `agree'  with 
        you," I smiled back, looking over the charts.  We would stay well 
        out, just within sight of land.  Given the speed at which we were 
        able to travel, it wasn't too likely that any spy could  transfer 
        information  swiftly enough to the Mexicans that our arrival  off 
        their shores wouldn't come as a complete "surprise" to them now!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  gave you Kathi to `use', and all I had was  my  `hand'," 
        Carol answered, turning about, facing me, her features in  shadow 
        against  the  glare of the sea.  I suspected that this  had  been 
        "bugging" Carol for some time, or she wouldn't have spoken so.  I 
        suspected  that this might have something to do with  her  coming 
        along on this voyage and leaving our little girl back home now...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "A  man can `use' a woman without feeling an emotional  com-
        mitment to her, but few women can enjoy sex without it," I  said.  
        There  have been "kept" men, but no actual "male prostitutes"  as 
        such.  Such "men" in the 20th and 21st Century being homosexuals.  
        I have no doubt that such practices still exist in this time, but 
        they do not seem to be "common", perhaps due to the fact that  in 
        this era heterosexual sex is more "available" than it was in  the 
        20th  Century due to the existence of legalized  prostitution  in 
        all countries of which I have knowledge, including those ruled by 
        the nomadic Nevadas and Wyomings.  It is noteworthy here to  note 
        that legalized prostitution existed in the early 20th Century be-
        fore women obtained the vote.  Women of course being no fools did 
        all they could to "outlaw" it for very much the same reasons that 
        any  union member of the same era always opposed "scab"  workers.  
        This  is clearly "understood" in this era, especially in  Dularn, 
        where as I have mentioned earlier, men even executed one of their 
        own Queens for "trespassing" where she should not have done.   It 
        is noteworthy here too that "feminism" in the sense it was  known 
        in the 20th and 21st Centuries is not "tolerated" to any  degree.  
        Lorraine  herself notes this in her first book, as does  Darlanis 
        in hers.  The "hostility" towards Queen Valeris in Dularn was  in 
        part caused by the "fact" that she was an "extreme" feminist  who 
        believed  that the world would be better off without men  in  it.  
        Much like the Women of Mars, who hold to much the same beliefs...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  could  take a `lover'," Carol smiled, the  tone  of  her 
        voice leaving little doubt that she was "teasing" me a bit  here.  
        Carol is the sort of a woman who requires an emotional commitment 
        to be able to actually "enjoy" sex with a man.  It was this  very 
        "commitment" to her that was the reason that she became my wife.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Probably `raise' a few eyebrows in Arsana," I smiled back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I am not considered `unattractive'," my brownette said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Your figure still is pretty good," I observed in return.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I fear I would not be as `good' in a bikini," she said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That is a matter of `opinion'," I smiled back at my wife.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I have `stretch marks' and my breasts sag a bit now," Carol 
        smiled.  That was true, although I suspected that after Hope  was 
        weaned that Carol's breasts would doubtless return to "normal"...  
        I had noticed that my wife seemed a bit "insecure" about herself.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  wouldn't say that you're `over the hill' quite  yet,"  I 
        answered,  Carol stepping forward, undoing her uniform coat,  the 
        "jut" of her breasts beneath the thin silk blouse she wore  leav-
        ing little doubt that she was still a very "attractive" wench...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "My  nipples are still too `tender' for clips," she  smiled.  
        I knew she was wearing a bra since otherwise she "drooped" now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You could probably stand to be `milked'," I answered her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "They  do feel rather `full'," my wife admitted to me  then.  
        It was necessary to keep Carol "milked" so that her milk wouldn't 
        "dry" up before we returned to Arsana.  A breast pump being  used 
        for  this purpose, some women "milking" themselves so  that  they 
        can "bottle feed" when necessary, although "nursing" is much more 
        common and no doubt is "better" for the baby, it is believed now.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "That one's `dry'," Carol breathed, sitting in my lap, naked 
        to the waist.  I took the glass breast pump from her left breast,  
        emptied  out the milk it contained and placed it over her  right.  
        The milk then spurting in a dribble from her nipple as I drew the 
        plunger back to create a vacuum.  A woman's milk is far  "richer" 
        than cow's milk, and has a high "fat" content.  This is why it is 
        perhaps  "better" for a baby than anything else as it  also  con-
        tains certain "trace elements" vital for the baby's own health.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "If we had coffee we could use it for `cream'," I smiled.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I bought some in Arsana before we left," she announced.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Just like being at home," I spoke, Carol nodding back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The one thing we can never have," my wife spoke softly.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Thanks to my allowing Tais to use that `Portal'," I said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It wasn't your fault and I doubt that the Priestesses would 
        ever  `trust' us to the point that they would allow us to  return 
        back to our own time," Carol answered, kissing me gently then...*
        
        * They "did", and we've never been "troubled" by the Martians.  I 
        have written this book in the knowledge that you will not believe 
        the "truth", that you will think of it as only "science fiction".  
        It is perhaps just as well that you don't "believe" what I write.  
        That is one of the reasons we left Hope for Queen Maris to raise.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You're still the `best' wife any man could have," I said to 
        Carol, holding her in my arms, the steady beat of the Diana's en-
        gines only a "background noise" that one hardly even noticed now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  may  not have `youth' any more, but I do  have  `experi-
        ence'," Carol smiled back, gently touching the swollen spot on my 
        lip that she'd bitten as she'd arched and scratched beneath me.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You're  still `better' than Kathi is," I told her in  turn.  
        It had been much like "old times" back in the Twentieth Century.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Kathi `promises' more than she can `deliver'," Carol  said.  
        "What makes a woman really `good in bed' isn't having big breasts 
        or a big behind, or even blonde hair, but the willingness to `let 
        go' and `give' of herself to her lover."  I knew she was right...
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Weather's getting up a bit," Sandra said to me,  indicating 
        the barometer, which had dropped considerably since earlier  this 
        afternoon.  We were a day out from Arsana, a couple hundred miles 
        south now.  To the east would be Orgon, the northernmost part  of 
        the  Empire.   The wave "pattern" now indicated a  storm  to  the 
        west, which would be a bit of trouble given our present course as 
        the  waves  would strike the Diana from the side, which  was  the 
        worse place to hit given the battleship's own "top heaviness".  I 
        was well aware that if the Diana was ever rolled more than  forty 
        five degrees from the horizontal that she'd probably go "over"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We'll make for the bay right here," I replied, pointing  it 
        out  on the chart, telling Sandra to go to three quarters,  which 
        would  increase  our speed from seven and a half knots  to  about 
        nine.  I would ride out the storm safely at anchor in this  Impe-
        rial controlled bay, and then proceed onwards after it was over.
