<h2 class="chapter">ARYA</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he man on the roof was the first to die. He was crouched down
by the chimney two hundred yards away, no more than a vague shadow
in the predawn gloom, but as the sky began to lighten he stirred,
stretched, and stood. Anguy&rsquo;s arrow took him in the chest. He
tumbled bonelessly down the steep slate pitch, and fell in front of
the septry door.</p>

<p>The Mummers had posted two guards there, but their torch left
them night blind, and the outlaws had crept in close. Kyle and
Notch let fly together. One man went down with an arrow through his
throat, the other through his belly. The second man dropped the
torch, and the flames licked up at him. He screamed as his clothes
took fire, and that was the end of stealth. Thoros gave a shout,
and the outlaws attacked in earnest.</p>

<p>Arya watched from atop her horse, on the crest of the wooded
ridge that overlooked the septry, mill, brewhouse, and stables and
the desolation of weeds, burnt trees, and mud that surrounded them.
The trees were mostly bare now, and the few withered brown leaves
that still clung to the branches did little to obstruct her view.
Lord Beric had left Beardless Dick and Mudge to guard them. Arya
hated being left behind like she was some stupid <em>child</em>, but at
least Gendry had been kept back as well. She knew better than to
try and argue. This was battle, and in battle you had to obey.</p>

<p>The eastern horizon glowed gold and pink, and overhead a half
moon peeked out through low scuttling clouds. The wind blew cold,
and Arya could hear the rush of water and the creak of the
mill&rsquo;s great wooden waterwheel. There was a smell of rain in
the dawn air, but no drops were falling yet. Flaming arrows flew
through the morning mists, trailing pale ribbons of fire, and
thudded into the wooden walls of the septry. A few smashed through
shuttered windows, and soon enough thin tendrils of smoke were
rising between the broken shutters.</p>

<p>Two Mummers came bursting from the septry side by side, axes in
their hands. Anguy and the other archers were waiting. One axeman
died at once. The other managed to duck, so the shaft ripped
through his shoulder. He staggered on, till two more arrows found
him, so quickly it was hard to say which had struck first. The long
shafts punched through his breastplate as if it had been made of
silk instead of steel. He fell heavily. Anguy had arrows tipped
with bodkins as well as broadheads. A bodkin could pierce even
heavy plate. <em>I&rsquo;m going to learn to shoot a bow</em>, Arya thought.
She loved sword fighting, but she could see how arrows were good
too.</p>

<p>Flames were creeping up the west wall of the septry, and thick
smoke poured through a broken window. A Myrish crossbowman poked
his head out a different window, got off a bolt, and ducked down to
rewind. She could hear fighting from the stables as well, shouts
well mingled with the screams of horses and the clang of steel.
<em>Kill them all</em>, she thought fiercely. She bit her lip so hard she
tasted blood. <em>Kill every single one</em>.</p>

<p>The crossbowman appeared again, but no sooner had he loosed than
three arrows hissed past his head. One rattled off his helm. He
vanished, bow and all. Arya could see flames in several of the
second-story windows. Between the smoke and the morning mists, the
air was a haze of blowing black and white. Anguy and the other
bowmen were creeping closer, the better to find targets.</p>

<p>Then the septry erupted, the Mummers boiling out like angry
ants. Two Ibbenese rushed through the door with shaggy brown
shields held high before them, and behind them came a Dothraki with
a great curved <em>arakh</em> and bells in his braid, and behind him three
Volantene sellswords covered with fierce tattoos. Others were
climbing out windows and leaping to the ground. Arya saw a man take
an arrow through the chest with one leg across a windowsill, and
heard his scream as he fell. The smoke was thickening. Quarrels and
arrows sped back and forth. Watty fell with a grunt, his bow
slipping from his hand. Kyle was trying to nock another shaft to
his string when a man in black mail flung a spear through his
belly. She heard Lord Beric shout. From out of the ditches and
trees the rest of his band came pouring, steel in hand. Arya saw
Lem&rsquo;s bright yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode down
the man who&rsquo;d killed Kyle. Thoros and Lord Beric were
everywhere, their swords swirling fire. The red priest hacked at a
hide shield until it flew to pieces, while his horse kicked the man
in the face. A Dothraki screamed and charged the lightning lord,
and the flaming sword leapt out to meet his <em>arakh</em>. The blades
kissed and spun and kissed again. Then the Dothraki&rsquo;s hair
was ablaze, and a moment later he was dead. She spied Ned too,
fighting at the lightning lord&rsquo;s side. <em>It&rsquo;s not fair,
he&rsquo;s only a little older than me, they should have let me
fight</em>.</p>

<p>The battle did not last very long. The Brave Companions still on
their feet soon died, or threw down their swords. Two of the
Dothraki managed to regain their horses and flee, but only because
Lord Beric let them go. &ldquo;Let them carry the word back to
Harrenhal,&rdquo; he said, with flaming sword in hand. &ldquo;It
will give the Leech Lord and his goat a few more sleepless
nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack-Be-Lucky, Harwin, and Merrit o&rsquo; Moontown braved the
burning septry to search for captives. They emerged from the smoke
and flames a few moments later with eight brown brothers, one so
weak that Merrit had to carry him across a shoulder. There was a
septon with them as well, round-shouldered and balding, but he wore
black chainmail over his grey robes. &ldquo;Found him hiding under
the cellar steps,&rdquo; said Jack, coughing.</p>

<p>Thoros smiled to see him. &ldquo;You are Utt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Septon</em> Utt. A man of god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What god would want the likes o&rsquo; you?&rdquo;
growled Lem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sinned,&rdquo; the septon wailed. &ldquo;I know, I
know. Forgive me, Father. Oh, grievously have I sinned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya remembered Septon Utt from her time at Harrenhal. Shagwell
the Fool said he always wept and prayed for forgiveness after
he&rsquo;d killed his latest boy. Sometimes he even made the other
Mummers scourge him. They all thought that was very funny.</p>

<p>Lord Beric slammed his sword into its scabbard, quenching the
flames. &ldquo;Give the dying the gift of mercy and bind the others
hand and foot for trial,&rdquo; he commanded, and it was done.</p>

<p>The trials went swiftly. Various of the outlaws came forward to
tell of things the Brave Companions had done; towns and villages
sacked, crops burned, women raped and murdered, men maimed and
tortured. A few spoke of the boys that Septon Utt had carried off.
The septon wept and prayed through it all. &ldquo;I am a weak
reed,&rdquo; he told Lord Beric. &ldquo;I pray to the Warrior for
strength, but the gods made me weak. Have mercy on my weakness. The
boys, the sweet boys&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I never mean to hurt
them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Septon Utt soon dangled beneath a tall elm, swinging slowly by
the neck, as naked as his name day. The other Brave Companions
followed one by one. A few fought, kicking and struggling as the
noose was tightened round their throats. One of the crossbowmen
kept shouting, &ldquo;I soldier, I soldier,&rdquo; in a thick
Myrish accent. Another offered to lead his captors to gold; a third
told them what a good outlaw he would make. Each was stripped and
bound and hanged in turn. Tom Sevenstrings played a dirge for them
on his woodharp, and Thoros implored the Lord of Light to roast
their souls until the end of time.</p>

<p><em>A mummer tree</em>, Arya thought as she watched them dangle, their
pale skins painted a sullen red by the flames of the burning
septry. Already the crows were coming, appearing out of nowhere.
She heard them croaking and cackling at one another, and wondered
what they were saying. Arya had not feared Septon Utt as much as
she did Rorge and Biter and some of the others still at Harrenhal,
but she was glad that he was dead all the same. <em>They should have
hanged the Hound too, or chopped his head off</em>. Instead, to her
disgust, the outlaws had treated Sandor Clegane&rsquo;s burned arm,
restored his sword and horse and armor, and set him free a few
miles from the hollow hill. All they&rsquo;d taken was his
gold.</p>

<p>The septry soon collapsed in a roar of smoke and flame, its
walls no longer able to support the weight of its heavy slate roof.
The eight brown brothers watched with resignation. They were all
that remained, explained the eldest, who wore a small iron hammer
on a thong about his neck to signify his devotion to the Smith.
&ldquo;Before the war we were four-and-forty, and this was a
prosperous place. We had a dozen milk cows and a bull, a hundred
beehives, a vineyard and an apple arbor. But when the lions came
through they took all our wine and milk and honey, slaughtered the
cows, and put our vineyard to the torch. After
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I have lost count of our visitors.
This false septon was only the latest. There was one
monster&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we gave him all our silver, but
he was certain we were hiding gold, so his men killed us one by one
to make Elder Brother talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the eight of you survive?&rdquo; asked Anguy the
Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;It was me.
When it came my turn to die, I told them where our gold was
hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Thoros of Myr, &ldquo;the only shame
was not telling them at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outlaws sheltered that night in the brewhouse beside the
little river. Their hosts had a cache of food hidden beneath the
floor of the stables, so they shared a simple supper; oaten bread,
onions, and a watery cabbage soup tasting faintly of garlic. Arya
found a slice of carrot floating in her bowl, and counted herself
lucky. The brothers never asked the outlaws for names. <em>They know</em>,
Arya thought. How could they not? Lord Beric wore the lightning
bolt on breastplate, shield, and cloak, and Thoros his red robes,
or what remained of them. One brother, a young novice, was bold
enough to tell the red priest not to pray to his false god so long
as he was under their roof. &ldquo;Bugger that,&rdquo; said Lem
Lemoncloak. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our god too, and you owe us for your
bloody lives. And what&rsquo;s false about him? Might be your Smith
can mend a broken sword, but can he heal a broken man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Lem,&rdquo; Lord Beric commanded. &ldquo;Beneath
their roof we will honor their rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun will not cease to shine if we miss a prayer or
two,&rdquo; Thoros agreed mildly. &ldquo;I am one who would
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Beric himself did not eat. Arya had never seen him eat,
though from time to time he took a cup of wine. He did not seem to
sleep, either. His good eye would often close, as if from
weariness, but when you spoke to him it would flick open again at
once. The Marcher lord was still clad in his ratty black cloak and
dented breastplate with its chipped enamel lightning. He even slept
in that breastplate. The dull black steel hid the terrible wound
the Hound had given him, the same way his thick woolen scarf
concealed the dark ring about his throat. But nothing hid his
broken head, all caved in at the temple, or the raw red pit that
was his missing eye, or the shape of the skull beneath his
face.</p>

<p>Arya looked at him warily, remembering all the tales told of him
in Harrenhal. Lord Beric seemed to sense her fear. He turned his
head, and beckoned her closer. &ldquo;Do I frighten you,
child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She chewed her lip.
&ldquo;Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
thought the Hound had killed you,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wound,&rdquo; said Lem Lemoncloak. &ldquo;A grievous
wound, aye, but Thoros healed it. There&rsquo;s never been no
better healer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Beric gazed at Lem with a queer look in his good eye and no
look at all in the other, only scars and dried blood. &ldquo;No
better healer,&rdquo; he agreed wearily. &ldquo;Lem, past time to
change the watch, I&rsquo;d think. See to it, if you&rsquo;d be so
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, m&rsquo;lord.&rdquo; Lem&rsquo;s big yellow cloak
swirled behind him as he strode out into the windy night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even brave men blind themselves sometimes, when they are
afraid to see,&rdquo; Lord Beric said when Lem was gone.
&ldquo;Thoros, how many times have you brought me back
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The red priest bowed his head. &ldquo;It is R&rsquo;hllor who
brings you back, my lord. The Lord of Light. I am only his
instrument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many times?&rdquo; Lord Beric insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; Thoros said reluctantly. &ldquo;And each time
is harder. You have grown reckless, my lord. Is death so very
sweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet? No, my friend. Not sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do not court it so. Lord Tywin leads from the rear.
Lord Stannis as well. You would be wise to do the same. A seventh
death might mean the end of both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Beric touched the spot above his left ear where his temple
was caved in. &ldquo;Here is where Ser Burton Crakehall broke helm
and head with a blow of his mace.&rdquo; He unwound his scarf,
exposing the black bruise that encircled his neck. &ldquo;Here the
mark the manticore made at Rushing Falls. He seized a poor
beekeeper and his wife, thinking they were mine, and let it be
known far and wide that he would hang them both unless I gave
myself up to him. When I did he hanged them anyway, and me on the
gibbet between them.&rdquo; He lifted a finger to the raw red pit
of his eye. &ldquo;Here is where the Mountain thrust his dirk
through my visor.&rdquo; A weary smile brushed his lips.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s thrice I have died at the hands of House
Clegane. You would think that I might have
learned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a jest, Arya knew, but Thoros did not laugh. He put a
hand on Lord Beric&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Best not to dwell on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on
the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but
I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that
woman&rsquo;s hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my
favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the
bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my
mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya stared at the Myrish priest, all shaggy hair and pink rags
and bits of old armor. Grey stubble covered his cheeks and the
sagging skin beneath his chin. He did not look much like the
wizards in Old Nan&rsquo;s stories, but even
so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you bring back a man without a head?&rdquo; Arya
asked. &ldquo;Just the once, not six times. Could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time,
his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I
knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving,
I gave him the good god&rsquo;s own kiss to send him on his way. I
filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down
his throat to lungs and heart and soul. <em>The last kiss</em> it is called,
and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord&rsquo;s
servants as they died. I had given it a time or two myself, as all
priests must. But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the
fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come open. It was not me who
raised him, my lady. It was the Lord. R&rsquo;hllor is not done
with him yet. Life is warmth, and warmth is fire, and fire is
God&rsquo;s and God&rsquo;s alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya felt tears well in her eyes. Thoros used a lot of words,
but all they meant was <em>no</em>, that much she understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father was a good man,&rdquo; Lord Beric said.
&ldquo;Harwin has told me much of him. For his sake, I would gladly
forgo your ransom, but we need the gold too desperately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chewed her lip. <em>That&rsquo;s true, I guess</em>. He had given the
Hound&rsquo;s gold to Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy provisions
south of the Mander, she knew. &ldquo;The last harvest burned, this
one is drowning, and winter will soon be on us,&rdquo; she had
heard him say when he sent them off. &ldquo;The smallfolk need
grain and seed, and we need blades and horses. Too many of my men
ride rounseys, drays, and mules against foes mounted on coursers
and destriers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya didn&rsquo;t know how much Robb would pay for her, though.
He was a king now, not the boy she&rsquo;d left at Winterfell with
snow melting in his hair. And if he knew the things she&rsquo;d
done, the stableboy and the guard at Harrenhal and all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
if my brother doesn&rsquo;t want to ransom me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would you think that?&rdquo; asked Lord Beric.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Arya said, &ldquo;my hair&rsquo;s messy and
my nails are dirty and my feet are all hard.&rdquo; Robb
wouldn&rsquo;t care about that, probably, but her mother would.
Lady Catelyn always wanted her to be like Sansa, to sing and dance
and sew and mind her courtesies. Just thinking of it made Arya try
to comb her hair with her fingers, but it was all tangles and mats,
and all she did was tear some out. &ldquo;I ruined that gown that
Lady Smallwood gave me, and I don&rsquo;t sew so good.&rdquo; She
chewed her lip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sew <em>very well</em>, I mean. Septa
Mordane used to say I had a blacksmith&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gendry hooted. &ldquo;Those soft little things?&rdquo; he called
out. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t even hold a hammer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could if I wanted!&rdquo; she snapped at him.</p>

<p>Thoros chuckled. &ldquo;Your brother will pay, child. Have no
fear on that count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what if he <em>won&rsquo;t</em>?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

<p>Lord Beric sighed. &ldquo;Then I will send you to Lady Smallwood
for a time, or perhaps to mine own castle of Blackhaven. But that
will not be necessary, I&rsquo;m certain. I do not have the power
to give you back your father, no more than Thoros does, but I can
at least see that you are returned safely to your mother&rsquo;s
arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you <em>swear</em>?&rdquo; she asked him. Yoren had promised to
take her home too, only he&rsquo;d gotten killed instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my honor as a knight,&rdquo; the lightning lord said
solemnly.</p>

<p>It was raining when Lem returned to the brewhouse, muttering
curses as water ran off his yellow cloak to puddle on the floor.
Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky sat by the door rolling dice, but no matter
which game they played one-eyed Jack had no luck at all. Tom
Sevenstrings replaced a string on his woodharp, and sang &ldquo;The
Mother&rsquo;s Tears,&rdquo; &ldquo;When Willum&rsquo;s Wife Was
Wet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day,&rdquo; and
then &ldquo;The Rains of Castamere.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="app2"><em>And who are you, the proud lord said,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>that I must bow so
low?</em><br></div></div>
<em>Only a cat of a different coat,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>that&rsquo;s all the truth I
know</em><br></div></div>
<em>In a coat of gold or a coat of red,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>a lion still has claws,</em><br></div></div>
<em>And mine are long and sharp, my lord,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>as long and sharp as yours.</em><br></div></div>
<em>And so he spoke, and so he spoke,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>that lord of Castamere,</em><br></div></div>
<em>But now the rains weep o&rsquo;er his hall,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>with no one there to hear.</em><br></div></div>
<em>Yes now the rains weep o&rsquo;er his hall,</em><br>
<div class="app5"><div class="app4"><em>and not a soul to hear.</em></div></div></div>

<p>Finally Tom ran out of rain songs and put away his harp. Then
there was only the sound of the rain itself beating down on the
slate roof of the brewhouse. The dice game ended, and Arya stood on
one leg and then the other listening to Merrit complain about his
horse throwing a shoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could shoe him for you,&rdquo; said Gendry, all of a
sudden. &ldquo;I was only a &rsquo;prentice, but my master said my
hand was made to hold a hammer. I can shoe horses, close up rents
in mail, and beat the dents from plate. I bet I could make swords
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you saying, lad?&rdquo; asked Harwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smith for you.&rdquo; Gendry went to one knee
before Lord Beric. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll have me, m&rsquo;lord, I
could be of use. I&rsquo;ve made tools and knives and once I made a
helmet that wasn&rsquo;t so bad. One of the Mountain&rsquo;s men
stole it from me when we was taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya bit her lip. <em>He means to leave me too</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would do better serving Lord Tully at
Riverrun,&rdquo; said Lord Beric. &ldquo;I cannot pay for your
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one ever did. I want a forge, and food to eat, some
place I can sleep. That&rsquo;s enough, m&rsquo;lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A smith can find a welcome most anywhere. A skilled
armorer even more so. Why would you choose to stay with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arya watched Gendry screw up his stupid face, thinking.
&ldquo;At the hollow hill, what you said about being King
Robert&rsquo;s men, and brothers, I liked that. I liked that you
gave the Hound a trial. Lord Bolton just hanged folk or took off
their heads, and Lord Tywin and Ser Amory were the same. I&rsquo;d
sooner smith for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got plenty of mail needs mending, m&rsquo;lord,&rdquo;
Jack reminded Lord Beric. &ldquo;Most we took off the dead, and
there&rsquo;s holes where the death came through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be a lackwit, boy,&rdquo; said Lem.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re outlaws. Lowborn scum, most of us, excepting his
lordship. Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be like Tom&rsquo;s fool
songs neither. You won&rsquo;t be stealing no kisses from a
princess, nor riding in no tourneys in stolen armor. You join us,
you&rsquo;ll end with your neck in a noose, or your head mounted up
above some castle gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more than they&rsquo;d do for you,&rdquo;
said Gendry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Jack-Be-Lucky
cheerfully. &ldquo;The crows await us all. M&rsquo;lord, the boy
seems brave enough, and we do have need of what he brings us. Take
him, says Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And quick,&rdquo; suggested Harwin, chuckling,
&ldquo;before the fever passes and he comes back to his
senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wan smile crossed Lord Beric&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Thoros, my
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the lightning lord did not set the blade afire, but
merely laid it light on Gendry&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Gendry, do
you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who
cannot defend themselves, to protect all women and children, to
obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight
bravely when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you,
however hard or humble or dangerous they may be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, m&rsquo;lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marcher lord moved the sword from the right shoulder to the
left, and said, &ldquo;Arise Ser Gendry, knight of the hollow hill,
and be welcome to our brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the door came rough, rasping laughter.</p>

<p>The rain was running off him. His burned arm was wrapped in
leaves and linen and bound tight against his chest by a crude rope
sling, but the older burns that marked his face glistened black and
slick in the glow of their little fire. &ldquo;Making more knights,
Dondarrion?&rdquo; the intruder said in a growl. &ldquo;I ought to
kill you all over again for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Beric faced him coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped we&rsquo;d
seen the last of you, Clegane. How did you come to find
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t hard. You made enough bloody smoke to be
seen in Oldtown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of the sentries I posted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clegane&rsquo;s mouth twitched. &ldquo;Those two blind men?
Might be I killed them both. What would you do if I had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anguy strung his bow. Notch was doing the same. &ldquo;Do you
wish to die so very much, Sandor?&rdquo; asked Thoros. &ldquo;You
must be mad or drunk to follow us here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk on rain? You didn&rsquo;t leave me enough gold to
buy a cup of wine, you whoresons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anguy drew an arrow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re outlaws. Outlaws steal.
It&rsquo;s in the songs, if you ask nice Tom may sing you one. Be
thankful we didn&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come try it, Archer. I&rsquo;ll take that quiver off you
and shove those arrows up your freckly little arse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anguy raised his longbow, but Lord Beric lifted a hand before he
could loose. &ldquo;Why did you come here, Clegane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get back what&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else? It wasn&rsquo;t for the pleasure of looking at
your face, Dondarrion, I&rsquo;ll tell you that. You&rsquo;re
uglier than me now. And a robber knight besides, it
seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave you a note for your gold,&rdquo; Lord Beric said
calmly. &ldquo;A promise to pay, when the war&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wiped my arse with your paper. I want the
gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have it. I sent it south with Greenbeard
and the Huntsman, to buy grain and seed across the
Mander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To feed all them whose crops you burned,&rdquo; said
Gendry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the tale, now?&rdquo; Sandor Clegane laughed
again. &ldquo;As it happens, that&rsquo;s just what I meant to do
with it. Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and their poxy
whelps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying,&rdquo; said Gendry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy has a mouth on him, I see. Why believe them and
not me? Couldn&rsquo;t be my face, could it?&rdquo; Clegane glanced
at Arya. &ldquo;You going to make her a knight too, Dondarrion? The
first eight-year-old girl knight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>twelve</em>,&rdquo; Arya lied loudly, &ldquo;and I
could be a knight if I wanted. I could have killed you too, only
Lem took my knife.&rdquo; Remembering that still made her
angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Complain to Lem, not me. Then tuck your tail between your
legs and run. Do you know what dogs do to wolves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time I <em>will</em> kill you. I&rsquo;ll kill your brother
too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; His dark eyes narrowed. &ldquo;That you
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He turned back to Lord Beric. &ldquo;Say, make
my horse a knight. He never shits in the hall and doesn&rsquo;t
kick more than most, he deserves to be knighted. Unless you meant
to steal him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best climb on that horse and go,&rdquo; warned Lem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with my gold. Your own god said I&rsquo;m
guiltless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord of Light gave you back your life,&rdquo;
declared Thoros of Myr. &ldquo;He did not proclaim you Baelor the
Blessed come again.&rdquo; The red priest unsheathed his sword, and
Arya saw that Jack and Merrit had drawn as well. Lord Beric still
held the blade he&rsquo;d used to dub Gendry. <em>Maybe this time
they&rsquo;ll kill him</em>.</p>

<p>The Hound&rsquo;s mouth gave another twitch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
no more than common thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lem glowered. &ldquo;Your lion friends ride into some village,
take all the food and every coin they find, and call it <em>foraging</em>.
The wolves as well, so why not us? No one robbed you, dog. You just
been good and <em>foraged</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sandor Clegane looked at their faces,
every one, as if he were trying to commit them all to memory. Then
he walked back out into the darkness and the pouring rain from
whence he&rsquo;d come, with never another word. The outlaws
waited, wondering&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I best go see what he did to our sentries.&rdquo; Harwin
took a wary look out the door before he left, to make certain the
Hound was not lurking just outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d that bloody bastard get all that gold
anyhow?&rdquo; Lem Lemoncloak said, to break the tension.</p>

<p>Anguy shrugged. &ldquo;He won the Hand&rsquo;s tourney. In
King&rsquo;s Landing.&rdquo; The bowman grinned. &ldquo;I won a
fair fortune myself, but then I met Dancy, Jayde, and Alayaya. They
taught me what roast swan tastes like, and how to bathe in Arbor
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pissed it all away, did you?&rdquo; laughed Harwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not <em>all</em>. I bought these boots, and this excellent
dagger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought t&rsquo;have bought some land and made one
o&rsquo; them roast swan girls an honest woman,&rdquo; said
Jack-Be-Lucky. &ldquo;Raised yourself a crop o&rsquo; turnips and a
crop o&rsquo; sons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warrior defend me! What a waste that would have been, to
turn my gold to turnips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like turnips,&rdquo; said Jack, aggrieved. &ldquo;I
could do with some mashed turnips right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thoros of Myr paid no heed to the banter. &ldquo;The Hound has
lost more than a few bags of coin,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;He has
lost his master and kennel as well. He cannot go back to the
Lannisters, the Young Wolf would never have him, nor would his
brother be like to welcome him. That gold was all he had left, it
seems to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody hell,&rdquo; said Watty the Miller.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come murder us in our sleep for sure,
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Lord Beric had sheathed his sword.
&ldquo;Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in our
sleep. Anguy, on the morrow, take the rear with Beardless Dick. If
you see Clegane still sniffing after us, kill his horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good horse,&rdquo; Anguy protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lem. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bloody rider
we should be killing. We could use that horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with Lem,&rdquo; Notch said. &ldquo;Let me
feather the dog a few times, discourage him some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Beric shook his head. &ldquo;Clegane won his life beneath
the hollow hill. I will not rob him of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord is wise,&rdquo; Thoros told the others.
&ldquo;Brothers, a trial by battle is a holy thing. You heard me
ask R&rsquo;hllor to take a hand, and you saw his fiery finger snap
Lord Beric&rsquo;s sword, just as he was about to make an end of
it. The Lord of Light is not yet done with Joffrey&rsquo;s Hound,
it would seem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harwin soon returned to the brewhouse. &ldquo;Puddingfoot was
sound asleep, but unharmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get hold of him,&rdquo; said Lem.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut him a new bunghole. He could have gotten
every one of us killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one rested very comfortably that night, knowing that Sandor
Clegane was out there in the dark, somewhere close. Arya curled up
near the fire, warm and snug, yet sleep would not come. She took
out the coin that Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar had given her and curled her
fingers around it as she lay beneath her cloak. It made her feel
strong to hold it, remembering how she&rsquo;d been the ghost in
Harrenhal. She could kill with a whisper then.</p>

<p>Jaqen was gone, though. He&rsquo;d left her. <em>Hot Pie left me
too, and now Gendry is leaving</em>. Lommy had died, Yoren had died,
Syrio Forel had died, even her father had died, and Jaqen had given
her a stupid iron penny and vanished. &ldquo;<em>Valar
morghulis</em>,&rdquo; she whispered softly, tightening her fist so the
hard edges of the coin dug into her palm. &ldquo;Ser Gregor,
Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound.
Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.&rdquo; Arya tried
to imagine how they would look when they were dead, but it was hard
to bring their faces to mind. The Hound she could see, and his
brother the Mountain, and she would never forget Joffrey&rsquo;s
face, or his mother&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but Raff and
Dunsen and Polliver were all fading, and even the Tickler, whose
looks had been so commonplace.</p>

<p>Sleep took her at last, but in the black of night Arya woke
again, tingling. The fire had burned down to embers. Mudge stood by
the door, and another guard was pacing outside. The rain had
stopped, and she could hear wolves howling. <em>So close</em>, she thought,
<em>and so many</em>. They sounded as if they were all around the stable,
dozens of them, maybe hundreds. <em>I hope they eat the Hound</em>. She
remembered what he&rsquo;d said, about wolves and dogs.</p>

<p>Come morning, Septon Utt still swung beneath the tree, but the
brown brothers were out in the rain with spades, digging shallow
graves for the other dead. Lord Beric thanked them for the
night&rsquo;s lodging and the meal, and gave them a bag of silver
stags to help rebuild. Harwin, Likely Luke, and Watty the Miller
went out scouting, but neither wolves nor hounds were found.</p>

<p>As Arya was cinching her saddle girth, Gendry came up to say
that he was sorry. She put a foot in the stirrup and swung up into
her saddle, so she could look down on him instead of up. <em>You could
have made swords at Riverrun for my brother</em>, she thought, but what
she said was, &ldquo;If you want to be some stupid outlaw knight
and get hanged, why should I care? I&rsquo;ll be at Riverrun,
ransomed, with my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no rain that day, thankfully, and for once they made
good time.</p>
