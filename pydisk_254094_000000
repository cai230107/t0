<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_19"></a>Chapter 19</h1>
<a id="p605" name="p605"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(605)" >Agonostis strolled into his "office." Earwax met him at the door. "Did I do okay, sir?"</p>
<a id="p606" name="p606"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(606)" >"For now." Agonostis looked around what had, the night before, been an abandoned warehouse. Rows of hastily erected cubicles (the Hell-bound were big on cubicles) filled the center of the floor. Computer cables snaked across the cracked concrete, running to special terminator boxes that linked them straight to Hell's mainframes.</p>
<a id="p607" name="p607"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(607)" >The Real Estate Devil scurried up to him and said, "We own the building now&#151;in fact, we own the entire block. We've thrown out the winos and the drug dealers and started fixing up the building next door. It will take some work, but I think we can make it respectable enough to use as a front."</p>
<a id="p608" name="p608"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(608)" >Agonostis nodded. "Good. Continue." The Real Estate Devil hurried off.</p>
<a id="p609" name="p609"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(609)" >"They fixed you up a temporary office in the back," Earwax said. "I think you'll approve. It has a great view of the hookers working the neighborhood."</p>
<a id="p610" name="p610"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(610)" >"There are hookers&#151;working <i>this</i> neighborhood!" Jezerael, who had taken Lust and Fornication away from him with her damned plotting, was making points with every one of those hookers. "Chase them down to the Salvation Army," he snapped. "Or call the police and have them arrested."</p>
<a id="p611" name="p611"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(611)" >Jezerael was not going to get any freebies from him.</p>
<a id="p612" name="p612"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(612)" >Earwax was still standing at his knee, waiting for . . . something. Who knew what went through the microscopic minds of imps?</p>
<a id="p613" name="p613"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(613)" >"What are you waiting for?"</p>
<a id="p614" name="p614"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(614)" >Earwax started. "Er . . . orders?"</p>
<a id="p615" name="p615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(615)" >He needed to have someone keep an eye on Dayne. "Fine. Here are some orders. Put a tap on Dayne Kuttner's phone. Then I want you to personally watch her house. Find out for me everything she does, every place she goes, every person she talks to."</p>
<a id="p616" name="p616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(616)" >"Can I answer her phone?"</p>
<a id="p617" name="p617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(617)" >"<i>No</i>, you can't answer her phone! She isn't supposed to know you're there."</p>
<a id="p618" name="p618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(618)" >He was forgetting something else . . . something important. . . .</p>
<a id="p619" name="p619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(619)" >The pets. "Don't bother her cats, either. No one had better touch those cats until I give the okay."</p>
<a id="p620" name="p620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(620)" >Earwax nodded, his expression mournful. "No cats. No phones. No fun." He trudged away, shoulders sagging.</p>
<a id="p621" name="p621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(621)" >Agonostis smiled and walked through his new domain. All his damned were busy, Hell Phase II was opening for business, and Dayne Kuttner was putty in his hands. The first phase of her temptation had gone remarkably well. He'd assumed he would have to make at least two trips by her home to find a form that would prove irresistible to the woman; to have hit his stride in one was, he thought, simply proof of his suitability for his role as Lord of Lust.</p>
<a id="p622" name="p622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(622)" >Jezerael would be out of a job before she knew what had hit her.</p>
<a id="p623" name="p623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(623)" >And spunky little wide-eyed Dayne would be writhing in Hell.</p>
<a id="p624" name="p624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(624)" >Agonostis' smile grew bigger.</p>
<a id="p625" name="p625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(625)" >&nbsp;</p>
