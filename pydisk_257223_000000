<h2 class="chapter">TYRION</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>yrion,&rdquo; Ser Kevan Lannister said wearily,
&ldquo;if you are indeed innocent of Joffrey&rsquo;s death, you
should have no difficulty proving it at trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion turned from the window. &ldquo;Who is to judge
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Justice belongs to the throne. The king is dead, but
your father remains Hand. Since it is his own son who stands
accused and his grandson who was the victim, he has asked Lord
Tyrell and Prince Oberyn to sit in judgment with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion was scarcely reassured. Mace Tyrell had been
Joffrey&rsquo;s goodfather, however briefly, and the Red Viper
was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, a snake. &ldquo;Will I be
allowed to demand trial by battle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not advise that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; It had saved him in the Vale, why not
here? &ldquo;Answer me, Uncle. Will I be allowed a trial by battle,
and a champion to prove my innocence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if such is your wish. However, you had best
know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor Clegane as <em>her</em>
champion, in the event of such a trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The bitch checks my moves before I make them. A pity she
didn&rsquo;t choose a Kettleblack</em>. Bronn would make short work of
any of the three brothers, but the Mountain That Rides was a kettle
of a different color. &ldquo;I shall need to sleep on this.&rdquo;
<em>I need to speak with Bronn, and soon</em>. He didn&rsquo;t want to think
about what this was like to cost him. Bronn had a lofty notion of
what his skin was worth. &ldquo;Does Cersei have witnesses against
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have witnesses of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me who you would have, and Ser Addam will send the
Watch to bring them to the trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would sooner find them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stand accused of regicide and kinslaying. Do you
truly imagine you will be allowed to come and go as you
please?&rdquo; Ser Kevan waved at the table. &ldquo;You have quill,
ink, and parchment. Write the names of such witnesses as you
require, and I shall do all in my power to produce them, you have
my word as a Lannister. But you shall not leave this tower, except
to go to trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion would not demean himself by begging. &ldquo;Will you
permit my squire to come and go? The boy Podrick Payne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if that is your wish. I shall send him to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do so. Sooner would be better than later, and now would
be better than sooner.&rdquo; He waddled to the writing table. But
when he heard the door open, he turned back and said,
&ldquo;Uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Kevan paused. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe that, Tyrion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the door closed, Tyrion Lannister pulled himself up into
the chair, sharpened a quill, and pulled a blank parchment. <em>Who
will speak for me?</em> He dipped his quill in the inkpot.</p>

<p>The sheet was still maiden when Podrick Payne appeared, sometime
later. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; the boy said.</p>

<p>Tyrion put down the quill. &ldquo;Find Bronn and bring him at
once. Tell him there&rsquo;s gold in it, more gold than he&rsquo;s
ever dreamt of, and see that you don&rsquo;t return without
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord. I mean, no. I won&rsquo;t. Return.&rdquo;
He went.</p>

<p>He had not returned by sunset, nor by moonrise. Tyrion fell
asleep in the window seat to wake stiff and sore at dawn. A serving
man brought porridge and apples to break his fast, with a horn of
ale. He ate at the table, the blank parchment before him. An hour
later, the serving man returned for the bowl. &ldquo;Have you seen
my squire?&rdquo; Tyrion asked him. The man shook his head.</p>

<p>Sighing, he turned back to the table, and dipped the quill
again. <em>Sansa</em>, he wrote upon the parchment. He sat staring at the
name, his teeth clenched so hard they hurt.</p>

<p>Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of
food, which even Tyrion found hard to swallow, Sansa must have
poisoned him. <em>Joff practically put his cup down in her lap, and
he&rsquo;d given her ample reason</em>. Any doubts Tyrion might have had
vanished when his wife did. <em>One flesh, one heart, one soul</em>. His
mouth twisted. <em>She wasted no time proving how much those vows meant
to her, did she? Well, what did you expect, dwarf?</em></p>

<p>And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;where would Sansa have gotten
poison? He could not believe the girl had acted alone in this. <em>Do I
really want to find her?</em> Would the judges believe that
Tyrion&rsquo;s child bride had poisoned a king without her
husband&rsquo;s knowledge? <em>I wouldn&rsquo;t</em>. Cersei would insist
that they had done the deed together.</p>

<p>Even so, he gave the parchment to his uncle the next day. Ser
Kevan frowned at it. &ldquo;Lady Sansa is your only
witness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think of others in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best think of them now. The judges mean to begin the
trial three days hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too soon. You have me shut up here under
guard, how am I to find witnesses to my innocence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister&rsquo;s had no difficulty finding witnesses
to your guilt.&rdquo; Ser Kevan rolled up the parchment. &ldquo;Ser
Addam has men hunting for your wife. Varys has offered a hundred
stags for word of her whereabouts, and a hundred dragons for the
girl herself. If the girl can be found she will be found, and I
shall bring her to you. I see no harm in husband and wife sharing
the same cell and giving comfort to one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too kind. Have you seen my squire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent him to you yesterday. Did he not come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came,&rdquo; Tyrion admitted, &ldquo;and then he
went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall send him to you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was the next morning before Podrick Payne returned. He
stepped inside the room hesitantly, with fear written all over his
face. Bronn came in behind him. The sellsword knight wore a jerkin
studded with silver and a heavy riding cloak, with a pair of
fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through his swordbelt.</p>

<p>One look at Bronn&rsquo;s face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in
the pit of his stomach. &ldquo;It took you long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy begged, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have come at all. I
am expected at Castle Stokeworth for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stokeworth?&rdquo; Tyrion hopped from the bed. &ldquo;And
pray, what is there for you in Stokeworth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bride.&rdquo; Bronn smiled like a wolf contemplating a
lost lamb. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to wed Lollys the day after
next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lollys.&rdquo; <em>Perfect, bloody perfect</em>. Lady
Tanda&rsquo;s lackwit daughter gets a knightly husband and a father
of sorts for the bastard in her belly, and Ser Bronn of the
Blackwater climbs another rung. It had Cersei&rsquo;s stinking
fingers all over it. &ldquo;My bitch sister has sold you a lame
horse. The girl&rsquo;s dim-witted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I wanted wits, I&rsquo;d marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lollys is big with another man&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when she pops him out, I&rsquo;ll get her big with
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not even heir to Stokeworth,&rdquo; Tyrion
pointed out. &ldquo;She has an elder sister. Falyse. A <em>married</em>
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married ten years, and still barren,&rdquo; said Bronn.
&ldquo;Her lord husband shuns her bed. It&rsquo;s said he prefers
virgins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could prefer goats and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. The
lands will still pass to his wife when Lady Tanda dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless Falyse should die before her mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion wondered whether Cersei had any notion of the sort of
serpent she&rsquo;d given Lady Tanda to suckle. <em>And if she does,
would she care?</em> &ldquo;Why are you here, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bronn shrugged. &ldquo;You once told me that if anyone ever
asked me to sell you out, you&rsquo;d double the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>. &ldquo;Is it two wives you want, or two castles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of each would serve. But if you want me to kill
Gregor Clegane for you, it had best be a damned <em>big</em>
castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Seven Kingdoms were full of highborn maidens, but even the
oldest, poorest, and ugliest spinster in the realm would balk at
wedding such lowborn scum as Bronn. <em>Unless she was soft of body and
soft of head, with a fatherless child in her belly from having been
raped half a hundred times</em>. Lady Tanda had been so desperate to
find a husband for Lollys that she had even pursued Tyrion for a
time, and that had been before half of King&rsquo;s Landing enjoyed
her. No doubt Cersei had sweetened the offer somehow, and Bronn <em>was</em>
a knight now, which made him a suitable match for a younger
daughter of a minor house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find myself woefully short of both castles and highborn
maidens at the moment,&rdquo; Tyrion admitted. &ldquo;But I can
offer you gold and gratitude, as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might be surprised. A Lannister pays his
debts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister is a Lannister too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady wife is heir to Winterfell. Should I emerge from
this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the
north in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If and when and might be,&rdquo; said Bronn. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s bloody cold up there. Lollys is soft, warm, and close. I
could be poking her two nights hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a prospect I would relish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Bronn grinned. &ldquo;Admit it, Imp.
Given a choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain,
you&rsquo;d have your breeches down and cock up before a man could
blink.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He knows me too bloody well</em>. Tyrion tried a different tack.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d heard that Ser Gregor was wounded on the Red Fork,
and again at Duskendale. The wounds are bound to slow
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bronn looked annoyed. &ldquo;He was never fast. Only freakish
big and freakish strong. I&rsquo;ll grant you, he&rsquo;s quicker
than you&rsquo;d expect for a man that size. He has a monstrous
long reach, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to feel blows the way a normal
man would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he frighten you so much?&rdquo; asked Tyrion,
hoping to provoke him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t frighten me, I&rsquo;d be a bloody
fool.&rdquo; Bronn gave a shrug. &ldquo;Might be I could take him.
Dance around him until he was so tired of hacking at me that he
couldn&rsquo;t lift his sword. Get him off his feet somehow. When
they&rsquo;re flat on their backs it don&rsquo;t matter how tall
they are. Even so, it&rsquo;s chancy. One misstep and I&rsquo;m
dead. Why should I risk it? I like you well enough, ugly little
whoreson that you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but if I fight your
battle, I lose either way. Either the Mountain spills my guts, or I
kill him and lose Stokeworth. I sell my sword, I don&rsquo;t give
it away. I&rsquo;m not your bloody brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tyrion sadly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not.&rdquo; He waved a hand. &ldquo;Begone, then. Run to Stokeworth
and Lady Lollys. May you find more joy in your marriage bed than I
ever found in mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bronn hesitated at the door. &ldquo;What will you do,
Imp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill Gregor myself. Won&rsquo;t <em>that</em> make for a jolly
song?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I hear them sing it.&rdquo; Bronn grinned one
last time, and walked out of the door, the castle, and his
life.</p>

<p>Pod shuffled his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Is it your fault that Bronn&rsquo;s an insolent
black-hearted rogue? He&rsquo;s always been an insolent
black-hearted rogue. That&rsquo;s what I liked about him.&rdquo;
Tyrion poured himself a cup of wine and took it to the window seat.
Outside the day was grey and rainy, but the prospect was still more
cheerful than his. He could send Podrick Payne questing after
Shagga, he supposed, but there were so many hiding places in the
deep of the kingswood that outlaws often evaded capture for
decades. <em>And Pod sometimes has difficulty finding the kitchens when
I send him down for cheese</em>. Timett son of Timett would likely be
back in the Mountains of the Moon by now. And despite what
he&rsquo;d told Bronn, going up against Ser Gregor Clegane in his
own person would be a bigger farce than Joffrey&rsquo;s jousting
dwarfs. He did not intend to die with gales of laughter ringing in
his ears. <em>So much for trial by combat</em>.</p>

<p>Ser Kevan paid him another call later that day, and again the
day after. Sansa had not been found, his uncle informed him
politely. Nor the fool Ser Dontos, who&rsquo;d vanished the same
night. Did Tyrion have any more witnesses he wished to summon? He
did not. <em>How do I bloody well prove I didn&rsquo;t poison the wine,
when a thousand people saw me fill Joff&rsquo;s cup?</em></p>

<p>He did not sleep at all that night.</p>

<p>Instead he lay in the dark, staring up at the canopy and
counting his ghosts. He saw Tysha smiling as she kissed him, saw
Sansa naked and shivering in fear. He saw Joffrey clawing his
throat, the blood running down his neck as his face turned black.
He saw Cersei&rsquo;s eyes, Bronn&rsquo;s wolfish smile,
Shae&rsquo;s wicked grin. Even thought of Shae could not arouse
him. He fondled himself, thinking that perhaps if he woke his cock
and satisfied it, he might rest more easily afterward, but it was
no good.</p>

<p>And then it was dawn, and time for his trial to begin.</p>

<p>It was not Ser Kevan who came for him that morning, but Ser
Addam Marbrand with a dozen gold cloaks. Tyrion had broken his fast
on boiled eggs, burned bacon, and fried bread, and dressed in his
finest. &ldquo;Ser Addam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had thought my
father might send the Kingsguard to escort me to trial. I am still
a member of the royal family, am I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, my lord, but I fear that most of the Kingsguard
stand witness against you. Lord Tywin felt it would not be proper
for them to serve as your guards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gods forbid we do anything <em>improper</em>. Please, lead
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was to be tried in the throne room, where Joffrey had died.
As Ser Addam marched him through the towering bronze doors and down
the long carpet, he felt the eyes upon him. Hundreds had crowded in
to see him judged. At least he hoped that was why they had come.
<em>For all I know, they&rsquo;re all witnesses against me</em>. He spied
Queen Margaery up in the gallery, pale and beautiful in her
mourning. <em>Twice wed and twice widowed, and only sixteen</em>. Her mother
stood tall to one side of her, her grandmother small on the other,
with her ladies in waiting and her father&rsquo;s household knights
packing the rest of the gallery.</p>

<p>The dais still stood beneath the empty Iron Throne, though all
but one table had been removed. Behind it sat stout Lord Mace
Tyrell in a gold mantle over green, and slender Prince Oberyn
Martell in flowing robes of striped orange, yellow, and scarlet.
Lord Tywin Lannister sat between them. <em>Perhaps there&rsquo;s hope
for me yet</em>. The Dornishman and the Highgardener despised each other.
<em>If I can find a way to use that</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The High Septon began with a prayer, asking the Father Above to
guide them to justice. When he was done the father below leaned
forward to say, &ldquo;Tyrion, did you kill King
Joffrey?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>He would not waste a heartbeat</em>. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; said Oberyn Martell
dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Sansa Stark do it, then?&rdquo; Lord Tyrell
demanded.</p>

<p><em>I would have, if I&rsquo;d been her</em>. Yet wherever Sansa was and
whatever her part in this might have been, she remained his wife.
He had wrapped the cloak of his protection about her shoulders,
though he&rsquo;d had to stand on a fool&rsquo;s back to do it.
&ldquo;The gods killed Joffrey. He choked on his pigeon
pie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tyrell reddened. &ldquo;You would blame the
bakers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them, or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.&rdquo;
Tyrion heard nervous laughter, and knew he&rsquo;d made a mistake.
<em>Guard your tongue, you little fool, before it digs your grave</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are witnesses against you,&rdquo; Lord Tywin said.
&ldquo;We shall hear them first. Then you may present your own
witnesses. You are to speak only with our leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was naught that Tyrion could do but nod.</p>

<p>Ser Addam had told it true; the first man ushered in was Ser
Balon Swann of the Kingsguard. &ldquo;Lord Hand,&rdquo; he began,
after the High Septon had sworn him to speak only truth, &ldquo;I
had the honor to fight beside your son on the bridge of ships. He
is a brave man for all his size, and I will not believe he did this
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur went through the hall, and Tyrion wondered what mad
game Cersei was playing. <em>Why offer a witness that believes me
innocent?</em> He soon learned. Ser Balon spoke reluctantly of how he
had pulled Tyrion away from Joffrey on the day of the riot.
&ldquo;He did strike His Grace, that&rsquo;s so. It was a fit of
wroth, no more. A summer storm. The mob near killed us
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the days of the Targaryens, a man who struck one of
the blood royal would lose the hand he struck him with,&rdquo;
observed the Red Viper of Dorne. &ldquo;Did the dwarf regrow his
little hand, or did you White Swords forget your duty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was of the blood royal himself,&rdquo; Ser Balon
answered. &ldquo;And the King&rsquo;s Hand beside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lord Tywin said. &ldquo;He was <em>acting</em> Hand, in
my stead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Meryn Trant was pleased to expand on Ser Balon&rsquo;s
account, when he took his place as witness. &ldquo;He knocked the
king to the ground and began kicking him. He shouted that it was
unjust that His Grace had escaped unharmed from the
mobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion began to grasp his sister&rsquo;s plan. <em>She began with a
man known to be honest, and milked him for all he would give. Every
witness to follow will tell a worse tale, until I seem as bad as
Maegor the Cruel and Aerys the Mad together, with a pinch of Aegon
the Unworthy for spice</em>.</p>

<p>Ser Meryn went on to relate how Tyrion had stopped
Joffrey&rsquo;s chastisement of Sansa Stark. &ldquo;The dwarf asked
His Grace if he knew what had happened to Aerys Targaryen. When Ser
Boros spoke up in defense of the king, the Imp threatened to have
him killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blount himself came next, to echo <em>that</em> sorry tale. Whatever
mislike Ser Boros might harbor toward Cersei for dismissing him
from the Kingsguard, he said the words she wanted all the same.</p>

<p>Tyrion could no longer hold his tongue. &ldquo;Tell the judges
what Joffrey was <em>doing</em>, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big jowly man glared at him. &ldquo;You told your savages to
kill me if I opened my mouth, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll tell
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyrion,&rdquo; Lord Tywin said. &ldquo;You are to speak
only when we call upon you. Take this for a warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion subsided, seething.</p>

<p>The Kettleblacks came next, all three of them in turn. Osney and
Osfryd told the tale of his supper with Cersei before the Battle of
the Blackwater, and of the threats he&rsquo;d made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told Her Grace that he meant to do her harm,&rdquo;
said Ser Osfryd. &ldquo;To hurt her.&rdquo; His brother Osney
elaborated. &ldquo;He said he would wait for a day when she was
happy, and make her joy turn to ashes in her mouth.&rdquo; Neither
mentioned Alayaya.</p>

<p>Ser Osmund Kettleblack, a vision of chivalry in immaculate scale
armor and white wool cloak, swore that King Joffrey had long known
that his uncle Tyrion meant to murder him. &ldquo;It was the day
they gave me the white cloak, my lords,&rdquo; he told the judges.
&ldquo;That brave boy said to me, &lsquo;Good Ser Osmund, guard me
well, for my uncle loves me not. He means to be king in my
place.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was more than Tyrion could stomach. &ldquo;<em>Liar!</em>&rdquo; He
took two steps forward before the gold cloaks dragged him back.</p>

<p>Lord Tywin frowned. &ldquo;Must we have you chained hand and
foot like a common brigand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion gnashed his teeth. <em>A second mistake, fool, fool, fool of
a dwarf. Keep your calm or you&rsquo;re doomed</em>. &ldquo;No. I beg
your pardons, my lords. His lies angered me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His truths, you mean,&rdquo; said Cersei. &ldquo;Father,
I beg you to put him in fetters, for your own protection. You see
how he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see he&rsquo;s a dwarf,&rdquo; said Prince Oberyn.
&ldquo;The day I fear a dwarf&rsquo;s wrath is the day I drown
myself in a cask of red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need no fetters.&rdquo; Lord Tywin glanced at the
windows, and rose. &ldquo;The hour grows late. We shall resume on
the morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, alone in his tower cell with a blank parchment and a
cup of wine, Tyrion found himself thinking of his wife. Not Sansa;
his first wife, Tysha. <em>The whore wife, not the wolf wife</em>. Her love
for him had been pretense, and yet he had believed, and found joy
in that belief. <em>Give me sweet lies, and keep your bitter truths</em>. He
drank his wine and thought of Shae. Later, when Ser Kevan paid his
nightly visit, Tyrion asked for Varys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe the eunuch will speak in your
defense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t know until I have talked with him. Send him
here, Uncle, if you would be so good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maesters Ballabar and Frenken opened the second day of trial.
They had opened King Joffrey&rsquo;s noble corpse as well, they
swore, and found no morsel of pigeon pie nor any other food lodged
in the royal throat. &ldquo;It was poison that killed him, my
lords,&rdquo; said Ballabar, as Frenken nodded gravely.</p>

<p>Then they brought forth Grand Maester Pycelle, leaning heavily
on a twisted cane and shaking as he walked, a few white hairs
sprouting from his long chicken&rsquo;s neck. He had grown too
frail to stand, so the judges permitted a chair to be brought in
for him, and a table as well. On the table were laid a number of
small jars. Pycelle was pleased to put a name to each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greycap,&rdquo; he said in a quavery voice, &ldquo;from
the toadstool. Nightshade, sweetsleep, demon&rsquo;s dance. This is
blindeye. Widow&rsquo;s blood, this one is called, for the color. A
cruel potion. It shuts down a man&rsquo;s bladder and bowels, until
he drowns in his own poisons. This wolfsbane, here basilisk venom,
and this one the tears of Lys. Yes. I know them all. The Imp Tyrion
Lannister stole them from my chambers, when he had me falsely
imprisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Pycelle</em>,&rdquo; Tyrion called out, risking his
father&rsquo;s wrath, &ldquo;could any of these poisons choke off a
man&rsquo;s breath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. For that, you must turn to a rarer poison. When I was
a boy at the Citadel, my teachers named it simply <em>the
strangler</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this rare poison was not found, was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo; Pycelle blinked at him. &ldquo;You
used it all to kill the noblest child the gods ever put on this
good earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion&rsquo;s anger overwhelmed his sense. &ldquo;Joffrey was
cruel and stupid, but I did not kill him. Have my head off if you
like, I had no hand in my nephew&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Silence!</em>&rdquo; Lord Tywin said. &ldquo;I have told you
thrice. The next time, you shall be gagged and chained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Pycelle came the procession, endless and wearisome. Lords
and ladies and noble knights, highborn and humble alike, they had
all been present at the wedding feast, had all seen Joffrey choke,
his face turning as black as a Dornish plum. Lord Redwyne, Lord
Celtigar, and Ser Flement Brax had heard Tyrion threaten the king;
two serving men, a juggler, Lord Gyles, Ser Hobber Redwyne, and Ser
Philip Foote had observed him fill the wedding chalice; Lady
Merryweather swore that she had seen the dwarf drop something into
the king&rsquo;s wine while Joff and Margaery were cutting the pie;
old Estermont, young Peckledon, the singer Galyeon of Cuy, and the
squires Morros and Jothos Slynt told how Tyrion had picked up the
chalice as Joff was dying and poured out the last of the poisoned
wine onto the floor.</p>

<p><em>When did I make so many enemies?</em> Lady Merryweather was all but a
stranger. Tyrion wondered if she was blind or bought. At least
Galyeon of Cuy had not set his account to music, or else there
might have been seventy-seven bloody verses to it.</p>

<p>When his uncle called that night after supper, his manner was
cold and distant. <em>He thinks I did it too</em>. &ldquo;Do you have
witnesses for us?&rdquo; Ser Kevan asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as such, no. Unless you&rsquo;ve found my
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His uncle shook his head. &ldquo;It would seem the trial is
going very badly for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think so? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;
Tyrion fingered his scar. &ldquo;Varys has not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor will he. On the morrow he testifies against
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Lovely</em>. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He shifted in his seat. &ldquo;I am
curious. You were always a fair man, Uncle. What convinced
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why steal Pycelle&rsquo;s poisons, if not to use
them?&rdquo; Ser Kevan said bluntly. &ldquo;And Lady Merryweather
saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;<em>nothing!</em> There was nothing to see. But how do I
prove that? How do I prove <em>anything</em>, penned up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the time has come for you to confess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even through the thick stone walls of the Red Keep, Tyrion could
hear the steady wash of rain. &ldquo;Say that again, Uncle? I could
swear you urged me to confess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were to admit your guilt before the throne and
repent of your crime, your father would withhold the sword. You
would be permitted to take the black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion laughed in his face. &ldquo;Those were the same terms
Cersei offered Eddard Stark. We all know how <em>that</em> ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father had no part in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That much was true, at least. &ldquo;Castle Black teems with
murderers, thieves and rapists,&rdquo; Tyrion said, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t recall meeting many regicides while I was there. You
expect me to believe that if I admit to being a kinslayer and
kingslayer, my father will simply nod, forgive me, and pack me off
to the Wall with some warm woolen smallclothes.&rdquo; He hooted
rudely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught was said of forgiveness,&rdquo; Ser Kevan said
sternly. &ldquo;A confession would put this matter to rest. It is
for that reason your father sends me with this offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank him kindly for me, Uncle,&rdquo; said Tyrion,
&ldquo;but tell him I am not presently in a confessing
mood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were I you, I&rsquo;d change my mood. Your sister wants
your head, and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to give it to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So one of my judges has already condemned me, without
hearing a word in my defense?&rdquo; It was no more than he
expected. &ldquo;Will I still be allowed to speak and present
witnesses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>have</em> no witnesses,&rdquo; his uncle reminded him.
&ldquo;Tyrion, if you are guilty of this enormity, the Wall is a
kinder fate than you deserve. And if you are
blameless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there is fighting in the north,
I know, but even so it will be a safer place for you than
King&rsquo;s Landing, whatever the outcome of this trial. The mob
is convinced of your guilt. Were you so foolish as to venture out
into the streets, they would tear you limb from limb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see how much that prospect upsets you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my brother&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might remind <em>him</em> of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you
were not his own blood, and Joanna&rsquo;s? Tywin seems a hard man
to you, I know, but he is no harder than he&rsquo;s had to be. Our
own father was gentle and amiable, but so weak his bannermen mocked
him in their cups. Some saw fit to defy him openly. Other lords
borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay it. At court they
japed of toothless lions. Even his mistress stole from him. A woman
scarcely one step above a whore, and she helped herself to my
mother&rsquo;s jewels! It fell to Tywin to restore House Lannister
to its proper place. Just as it fell to him to rule this realm,
when he was no more than twenty. He bore that heavy burden for
<em>twenty years</em>, and all it earned him was a mad king&rsquo;s envy.
Instead of the honor he deserved, he was made to suffer slights
beyond count, yet he gave the Seven Kingdoms peace, plenty, and
justice. He is a just man. You would be wise to trust
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion blinked in astonishment. Ser Kevan had always been solid,
stolid, pragmatic; he had never heard him speak with such fervor
before. &ldquo;You love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will think on what
you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think carefully, then. And quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought of little else that night, but come morning was no
closer to deciding if his father could be trusted. A servant
brought him porridge and honey to break his fast, but all he could
taste was bile at the thought of confession. <em>They will call me
kinslayer till the end of my days. For a thousand years or more, if
I am remembered at all, it will be as the monstrous dwarf who
poisoned his young nephew at his wedding feast</em>. The thought made
him so bloody angry that he flung the bowl and spoon across the
room and left a smear of porridge on the wall. Ser Addam Marbrand
looked at it curiously when he came to escort Tyrion to trial, but
had the good grace not to inquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Varys,&rdquo; the herald said, &ldquo;master of
whisperers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Powdered, primped, and smelling of rosewater, the Spider rubbed
his hands one over the other all the time he spoke. <em>Washing my life
away</em>, Tyrion thought, as he listened to the eunuch&rsquo;s mournful
account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the
Hound&rsquo;s protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of
having Tommen as king. <em>Half-truths are worth more than outright
lies</em>. And unlike the others, Varys had documents; parchments
painstakingly filled with notes, details, dates, whole
conversations. So much material that its recitation took all day,
and so much of it damning. Varys confirmed Tyrion&rsquo;s midnight
visit to Grand Maester Pycelle&rsquo;s chambers and the theft of
his poisons and potions, confirmed the threat he&rsquo;d made to
Cersei the night of their supper, confirmed every bloody thing but
the poisoning itself. When Prince Oberyn asked him how he could
possibly know all this, not having been present at any of these
events, the eunuch only giggled and said, &ldquo;My little birds
told me. Knowing is their purpose, and mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>How do I question a little bird?</em> thought Tyrion. <em>I should have
had the eunuch&rsquo;s head off my first day in King&rsquo;s
Landing. Damn him. And damn me for whatever trust I put in him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we heard it all?&rdquo; Lord Tywin asked his
daughter as Varys left the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; said Cersei. &ldquo;I beg your leave to
bring one final witness before you, on the morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Lord Tywin said.</p>

<p><em>Oh, good</em>, thought Tyrion savagely. <em>After this farce of a trial,
execution will almost come as a relief</em>.</p>

<p>That night, as he sat by his window drinking, he heard voices
outside his door. <em>Ser Kevan, come for my answer</em>, he thought at
once, but it was not his uncle who entered.</p>

<p>Tyrion rose to give Prince Oberyn a mocking bow. &ldquo;Are
judges permitted to visit the accused?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princes are permitted to go where they will. Or so I told
your guards.&rdquo; The Red Viper took a seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father will be displeased with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on
my list of concerns. Is it Dornish wine you&rsquo;re
drinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Arbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oberyn made a face. &ldquo;Red water. Did you poison
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince smiled. &ldquo;Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours?
Someone is going to cut it out one of these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not the first to tell me that. Perhaps I should
cut it out myself, it seems to make no end of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve seen. I think I may drink some of Lord
Redwyne&rsquo;s grape juice after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you like.&rdquo; Tyrion served him a cup.</p>

<p>The man took a sip, sloshed it about in his mouth, and
swallowed. &ldquo;It will serve, for the moment. I will send you up
some strong Dornish wine on the morrow.&rdquo; He took another sip.
&ldquo;I have turned up that golden-haired whore I was hoping
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you found Chataya&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Chataya&rsquo;s I bedded the black-skinned girl.
Alayaya, I believe she is called. Exquisite, despite the stripes on
her back. But the whore I referred to is your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she seduced you yet?&rdquo; Tyrion asked,
unsurprised.</p>

<p>Oberyn laughed aloud. &ldquo;No, but she will if I meet her
price. The queen has even hinted at marriage. Her Grace needs
another husband, and who better than a prince of Dorne? Ellaria
believes I should accept. Just the thought of Cersei in our bed
makes her wet, the randy wench. And we should not even need to pay
the dwarf&rsquo;s penny. All your sister requires from me is one
head, somewhat overlarge and missing a nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; said Tyrion, waiting.</p>

<p>By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine, and said,
&ldquo;When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne so long ago, he left
the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear.
This Tyrell moved with his tail from keep to keep, chasing rebels
and making certain that our knees stayed bent. He would arrive in
force, take a castle for his own, stay a moon&rsquo;s turn, and
ride on to the next castle. It was his custom to turn the lords out
of their own chambers and take their beds for himself. One night he
found himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy. A sash hung down near
the pillows, should he wish to summon a wench. He had a taste for
Dornish women, this Lord Tyrell, and who can blame him? So he pulled
upon the sash, and when he did the canopy above him split open, and
a hundred red scorpions fell down upon his head. His death lit a
fire that soon swept across Dorne, undoing all the Young
Dragon&rsquo;s victories in a fortnight. The kneeling men stood up,
and we were free again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the tale,&rdquo; said Tyrion. &ldquo;What of
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this. If I should ever find a sash beside my own
bed, and pull on it, I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me
than the queen in all her naked beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyrion grinned. &ldquo;We have that much in common,
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, I have much to thank your sister for. If not
for her accusation at the feast, it might well be you judging me
instead of me judging you.&rdquo; The prince&rsquo;s eyes were dark
with amusement. &ldquo;Who knows more of poison than the Red Viper
of Dorne, after all? Who has better reason to want to keep the
Tyrells far from the crown? And with Joffrey in his grave, by
<em>Dornish</em> law the Iron Throne should pass next to his sister
Myrcella, who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew, thanks
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dornish law does not apply.&rdquo; Tyrion had been so
ensnared in his own troubles that he&rsquo;d never stopped to
consider the succession. &ldquo;My father will crown Tommen, count
on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may indeed crown Tommen, here in King&rsquo;s Landing.
Which is not to say that my brother may not crown Myrcella, down in
Sunspear. Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your
nephew? Will your sister?&rdquo; He gave a shrug. &ldquo;Perhaps I
should marry Queen Cersei after all, on the condition that she
support her daughter over her son. Do you think she
would?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Never</em>, Tyrion wanted to say, but the word caught in his throat.
Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of her
sex. <em>If Dornish law applied in the west, she would be the heir to
Casterly Rock in her own right</em>. She and Jaime were twins, but
Cersei had come first into the world, and that was all it took. By
championing Myrcella&rsquo;s cause she would be championing her
own. &ldquo;I do not know how my sister would choose, between
Tommen and Myrcella,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It makes no
matter. My father will never give her that choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; said Prince Oberyn, &ldquo;may not
live forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something about the way he said it made the hairs on the back of
Tyrion&rsquo;s neck bristle. Suddenly he was mindful of Elia again,
and all that Oberyn had said as they crossed the field of ashes. <em>He
wants the head that spoke the words, not just the hand that swung
the sword</em>. &ldquo;It is not wise to speak such treasons in the Red
Keep, my prince. The little birds are listening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them. Is it treason to say a man is mortal? <em>Valar
morghulis</em> was how they said it in Valyria of old. <em>All men must die</em>.
And the Doom came and proved it true.&rdquo; The Dornishman went to
the window to gaze out into the night. &ldquo;It is being said that
you have no witnesses for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be
enough to persuade you all of my innocence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, my lord. The Fat Flower of Highgarden
is quite convinced of your guilt, and determined to see you die.
His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too, as he has
reminded us half a hundred times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; said Tyrion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men are seldom as they appear. You look so very guilty
that I am convinced of your innocence. Still, you will likely be
condemned. Justice is in short supply this side of the mountains.
There has been none for Elia, Aegon, or Rhaenys. Why should there
be any for you? Perhaps Joffrey&rsquo;s real killer was eaten by a
bear. That seems to happen quite often in King&rsquo;s Landing. Oh,
wait, the bear was at Harrenhal, now I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the game we are playing?&rdquo; Tyrion rubbed at
his scarred nose. He had nothing to lose by telling Oberyn the
truth. &ldquo;There <em>was</em> a bear at Harrenhal, and it did kill Ser
Amory Lorch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sad for him,&rdquo; said the Red Viper. &ldquo;And
for you. Do all noseless men lie so badly, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not lying. Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out
from under her father&rsquo;s bed and stabbed her to death. He had
some men-at-arms with him, but I do not know their names.&rdquo; He
leaned forward. &ldquo;It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince
Aegon&rsquo;s head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with
his blood and brains still on his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this, now? Truth, from a Lannister?&rdquo; Oberyn
smiled coldly. &ldquo;Your father gave the commands,
yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He spoke the lie without hesitation, and never
stopped to ask himself why he should.</p>

<p>The Dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow. &ldquo;Such a
dutiful son. And such a very feeble lie. It was Lord Tywin who
presented my sister&rsquo;s children to King Robert all wrapped up
in crimson Lannister cloaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father.
He was there. I was at the Rock, and still so young that I thought
the thing between my legs was only good for pissing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are here now, and in some difficulty, I
would say. Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face,
but it will not save you. No more than your father will.&rdquo; The
Dornish prince smiled. &ldquo;But I might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Tyrion studied him. &ldquo;You are one judge
in three. How could you save me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as your judge. As your champion.&rdquo;</p>
