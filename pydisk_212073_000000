<h2 class="chapter">38</h2>

<p>There you are! So here we are again. You were
missed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;faceless thing that, nevertheless,
seems to be smiling, pleased with itself.</p>

<p>It has been a night full of adventures. Has it not? And the fun
continues. Look. There. The Black Company and their auxiliaries
have begun making life especially unpleasant for Shadowlanders so
bold as to have taken up residence inside Dejagore&rsquo;s
wall.</p>

<p>See how they use the doppelgangers and imaginary soldiers to
lure the southerners into deadly traps, to get them to betray
themselves.</p>

<p>Oh. And come back to the wall. This is a small thing but it
could become the stuff of epics.</p>

<p>The fighting has all shifted to the east side of the city.
Hardly anybody is over there now. A few men to watch from the
ramparts is all. And some unenthusiastic Shadowlander scouts down
there in the darkness, not really paying attention. Otherwise how
could they miss this spidery little figure rappelling down the
outside of the wall?</p>

<p>Why on earth would a two-hundred-year-old, fourth-rate sorcerer
want to climb down a rope to go where very unfriendly little brown
men might decide to dance on his head?</p>

<p>The wounded stallion of mysterious sorcerous breed has stopped
screaming. At last. It is dead. Green misty stuff still rises from
its death wound. The wound still glows at its edges.</p>

<p>Out there? Yes. Look at them. Two very devils they are,
aren&rsquo;t they, cloaked in their pink mists? They don&rsquo;t
seem to be coming to devour the city, though, do they?</p>

<p>What is that? The Shadowlanders out there are scattering like
the fox is in the henhouse. Their cries are filled with pure
terror. Amongst them something dark moves swiftly. Look. It pulled
a man down there. Didn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>There is so little light now that the focus of battle has
shifted. The old man is as black as the heart of the night itself.
Think any mortal eye will notice him sneaking around among the
dead? Where is he headed? Shadowspinner&rsquo;s dead horse?</p>

<p>Who would expect that? It&rsquo;s the act of a madman.</p>

<p>The creeping darkness is moving toward the dead horse, too. See
how its eyes flash red when the fires in the city flare up. Look at
that fool, running toward it instead of away. There go his guts.
Stupidity can be fatal.</p>

<p>The little black man has vanished because he has stopped moving.
There he is. He heard something. There he goes, trotting toward the
dead stallion. He wants his spear back. And maybe that does make
some crazy sense. He worked hard making it.</p>

<p>He has stopped again, eye huge as he sniffs the night and
catches an almost-forgotten odor. At the same moment the deadly
darkness catches wind of him.</p>

<p>A pantherine roar of triumph stills hearts all across the plain.
The darkness begins moving faster and faster.</p>

<p>The little black man grabs his spear and runs for the wall. Will
he make it? Can two stubby, ancient legs carry him there fast
enough to escape the death racing toward him? The thing is huge.
And it is filled with joy. The little man reaches the rope. But he
is still eighty feet down from safety. And he is old and winded. He
whirls. His timing is perfect. The head of his spear reaches out
just as the monster leaps. The beast twists in the air, evading the
killing thrust but taking a cruel wound from its snout back through
its left ear. It howls. Green mist boils off its redly-glowing
wound. The beast loses all interest in the old man, who begins his
long climb to the ramparts. That bizarrely carved spear is slung
across his back now, held there by a mundane length of cotton
string.</p>

<p>No one notices. No one cares. The fighting has gone
elsewhere.</p>

<p>At times they are running, sometimes just slinking away through the
shadows before death overhauls them.</p>

<p>Look there. Shadowspinner, the king enemy himself, all but
crippled, paying no attention to anyone or anything but those two
pink-limned archetypes come out of the hills to devour him.</p>

<p>And Mogaba? Watch him be the master tactician. Watch him be the
ultimate warrior exploiting the enemy&rsquo;s every weakness now
that there is no chance to accomplish the deviltry that moved him
earlier in the evening. See that? No southerner, however great
his reputation, dares come near Mogaba. Even their great heroes are
like novice children when he steps forward himself.</p>

<p>He is way bigger than life, this Mogaba.</p>

<p>He is the triumphant centerpiece of his own imagined saga.</p>

<p>Something has gone out of the southerners.</p>

<p>They wanted to conquer. They knew they had to conquer because
their master Shadowspinner would not tolerate anything less. He has
a particular lack of understanding when it comes to failure. His
followers are established solidly inside the city. Mild
stubbornness will give them success.</p>

<p>But they are on the run.</p>

<p>Something has grabbed hold of them and convinced them that it is
not possible for even their souls to survive if they stay inside
Dejagore.</p>
