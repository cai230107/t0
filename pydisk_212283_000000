<h2 class="chapter">34</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> settled into a
chair outside the cage where Narayan Singh was being kept. He was
awake but he ignored me. I said, &ldquo;The Daughter of Night still
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know if you&rsquo;d harmed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you need to know this. She isn&rsquo;t going to stay
unharmed a whole lot longer. The only reason she&rsquo;s healthy
now is that we want your cooperation. If we can&rsquo;t get it,
then there&rsquo;s not much reason to keep on feeding her. Or you,
either. Though I do intend to keep my word about taking care of
you. Because I&rsquo;d want you to see everything you value
destroyed before you&rsquo;re allowed to die yourself. Which
reminds me. Aridatha couldn&rsquo;t be with us tonight. His captain
was concerned that there might be some unrest. Another Bhodi
disciple planned to burn himself. So we&rsquo;ll have to wait until
tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Narayan made a sound like a whispered moan. He did not want to
have to acknowledge my existence, for existence, and mine in
particular, was making him very unhappy. Which made me happy,
though I had no personal grudge. My enmity was all very sanitary,
very institutional, very much on behalf of my brothers who had been
injured. And on behalf of my brothers who were imprisoned beneath
the earth.</p>

<p>I suggested, &ldquo;Maybe you should go to Kina for
guidance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a look he gave me. Narayan Singh had no sense of humor and
did not recognize sarcasm when it struck from the grass and sank
its fangs in his ankle.</p>

<p>I told him, &ldquo;Just to recap: I don&rsquo;t have much
patience left. I don&rsquo;t have much time left. We&rsquo;ve
leaped onto the tiger&rsquo;s back. The big catfight is
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catfight. Universal male slang for a squabble amongst women.</p>

<p>Oh, really?</p>

<p>It had just occurred to me. We were all women in this fight.
Sahra and I. The Radisha and Soulcatcher. Kina and the Daughter of
Night. Uncle Doj was as close to a principal as any man was right
now. And Narayan, though he was mainly the Daughter of
Night&rsquo;s shadow.</p>

<p>Strange. Strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Narayan, when the fur starts flying, I won&rsquo;t be
much interested in looking out for your friend. But I&rsquo;m
definitely going to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this thing.&rdquo; Singh&rsquo;s voice
was almost inaudible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work on it, Narayan. If you love the girl. If you
don&rsquo;t want your goddess to have to start all over from
scratch.&rdquo; I thought I had that much power. By killing the
right people, I could lay Kina down to sleep for another age. And I
would if I could not get my own brothers out of the ground.</p>

<p>I found Banh Do Trang awaiting me in the little corner where I
worked and slept. He did not look well, which was not surprising.
He was not too many years younger than Goblin and did not have
Goblin&rsquo;s wondrous resources. &ldquo;Can I be of any service,
Uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand Doj told you the story of our people.&rdquo;
The best he could manage was a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me <em>a</em> story. There&rsquo;re always doubts left
behind when any Nyueng Bao shares a secret with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hen. Heh-heh. You&rsquo;re a bright young woman, Sleepy.
Few illusions and no obvious obsessions. I think Doj was as honest
with you as he could compel himself to be. Assuming he was honest
with me when he consulted me afterward. He finally heard me when I
told him that this&rsquo;s a new age. That that was what Hong Tray
wanted to show us when she chose the <em>jengal</em> to become Sahra&rsquo;s
husband. We&rsquo;re all lost children. We must join hands. That,
too, is what Hong Tray wanted us to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could&rsquo;ve said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was Hong Tray. A seeress. A Nyueng Bao seeress. Would
you have her issue blunt rescripts like the Radisha and
Protector?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do Trang chuckled. Then he seemed to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Was that that? I wondered. &ldquo;Uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh? Oh? I&rsquo;m sorry, young woman. Listen. I
don&rsquo;t think anyone else has mentioned it. Maybe no one else
but Gota and I have seen it. But there&rsquo;s a ghost in this
place. We&rsquo;ve seen it several times the past two
nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo; Was Murgen getting so strong people were
starting to see him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold and evil thing, Sleepy. Like something
that&rsquo;s happiest skulking around the mouths of graves or
slithering through a mountain of bones. Like that vampire child in
the tiger cage. You should be very wary of her. And I think I
should find my way to bed. Before I fall asleep here and your
friends begin to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re going to gossip about me, I can&rsquo;t
think of anyone I&rsquo;d rather have them connect me
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someday when I&rsquo;m young again. Next time around the
Wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought I might read for a while but I fell asleep almost
instantly. Sometime during the night I discovered that Do
Trang&rsquo;s ghost did exist. I awakened, instantly alert, and saw
a vaguely human shimmer standing nearby, evidently watching me. The
old man had done a good job describing it, too. I wondered if it
might not be Death Himself.</p>

<p>It went away as soon as it sensed my scrutiny.</p>

<p>I lay there trying to put it together. Murgen? Soulcatcher
spying? An unknown? Or what it felt like, the girl in the tiger
cage out for an ectoplasmic stroll?</p>

<p>I tried reason but was still too tired to stick with it
long.</p>
