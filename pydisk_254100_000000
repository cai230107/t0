<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_25"></a>Chapter 25</h1>
<a id="p819" name="p819"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(819)" >Jezerael studied the computerized notes about Dayne Kuttner and compared them with details about Agonostis' movements. She read the bio in slow-time, went over informed speculation about why Dayne had made the prayer she had . . . and then she looked with careful attention to detail at Lucifer's annotations on the spy's reports of her archenemy's approach to the problem of Dayne Kuttner.</p>
<a id="p820" name="p820"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(820)" >She began to laugh. "The stupid bastard is trying to damn her with lust . . . with <i>lust</i>! She went without sex from the day her husband died until the present, and it would be obvious to anyone but a moron that she simply hasn't wanted to debauch herself&#151;she's had as many opportunities as anyone could." Jezerael leaned back in her chair and smiled slyly. "I can see now that it's definitely possible to stay too long in one job, and think the familiar solutions are the only solutions that can work. Lucky for me I'm broader in thought and clearer in sight than that."</p>
<a id="p821" name="p821"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(821)" >Jezerael had to admit that Dayne was showing interest in Agonostis' cover persona. It wasn't the sort of interest that was going to land Dayne in Hell&#151;at least Jezerael didn't think it was, but she thought she would be wise to destroy any chance Agonostis had of finessing Dayne into the corral. Timing would be very important; she'd have to find a moment that would leave Dayne feeling totally hurt and betrayed. She smiled as the perfect scenario occurred to her. She'd have to see about getting a reliable spy of her own, so she could keep tabs on Dayne and Agonostis; if he was any damned good at his job at all, Jezerael's moment would come.</p>
<a id="p822" name="p822"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(822)" >And then she needed to devise her own plan of seduction.</p>
<a id="p823" name="p823"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(823)" >She didn't know what that would be yet . . . but it would be something Dayne would find irresistible.</p>
