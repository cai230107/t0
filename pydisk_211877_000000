MAKING UP MY MIND</h2>

<p>She never once demanded anything. Even her hints were so oblique
they left everything to me to work out. Two days after our evening
on the ramparts I asked the Colonel if I might see her. He said he
would ask. I suspect he was under instructions. Otherwise there
would have been arguments.</p>

<p>Another day passed before he came to say the Lady had time for
me.</p>

<p>I closed my inkwell, cleaned my quill, and rose. &ldquo;Thank
you.&rdquo; He looked at me oddly. &ldquo;Is something
wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I understood. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. I&rsquo;m sure
she has some special use for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That brightened the Colonel&rsquo;s day. That he could
comprehend.</p>

<p>The usual routine. This time I entered her demense as she stood
at a window opening on a world of wet gloom. Grey rain, choppy
brown water, and hulking to the left, shapes barely discernible,
trees clinging precariously to a high river bank. Cold and misery
leaked out of that portraiture. It had a too familiar smell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Tragic River,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In full
flood. But it&rsquo;s always in flood, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She
beckoned. I followed. Since my last visit a large table had been
added. Atop it was a miniature of the Barrowland, a representation
so good it was spooky. You almost expected to see little Guards
scurrying around the compound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Though I&rsquo;ve been there twice, I&rsquo;m not
familiar with much but the town and the compound. What am I
supposed to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The river. Your friend Raven evidently recognized its
import.&rdquo; With one delicate finger she sketched a loop well to
the east of the river&rsquo;s course, which curved into the ridge
where we had camped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time of my triumph in Juniper the river&rsquo;s
bed lay here. A year later the weather turned. The river flooded
continuously. And crept this way. Today it&rsquo;s devouring this
ridge. I examined it myself. The ridge is entirely earthen, without
bones of stone. It won&rsquo;t last. Once it goes, the river will
cut into the Barrowland. All the spells of the White Rose
won&rsquo;t keep it from opening the Great Barrow. Each fetish
swept away will make it that much easier for my husband to
rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grunted. &ldquo;Against Nature there is no defense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is. If one foresees. The White Rose did not. I did
not when I attempted to bind him more securely. Now it&rsquo;s too
late. So. You wanted to speak to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have to leave the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So. You didn&rsquo;t have to come to me about that.
You&rsquo;re free to stay or go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going because there&rsquo;re things I have to
do. As you well know. If I walk, I&rsquo;ll probably get them done
too late. It&rsquo;s a long hike to the Plain. Not to mention
risky. I want to beg transportation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, and this smile was genuine, radiant, subtly
different from previous smiles. &ldquo;Good. I thought you would
see where the future lies. How soon can you be ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes. There is one question. Raven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raven has been hospitalized at the compound at the
Barrowland. Nothing can be done for him right now. Every effort
will be made when an opportunity arises. Sufficient?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not argue, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Transport will be available. You will have a unique
chauffeur. The Lady herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, have been thinking. My best next step is to meet
your White Rose. I&rsquo;m going with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After gulping quarts of air, I managed, &ldquo;They&rsquo;d jump
all over you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if they don&rsquo;t know me. They wouldn&rsquo;t,
unless they were told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, no one was likely to recognize her. I am unique in having
met her and lived to brag on it. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
Gods, the heaps and bales of buts. &ldquo;If you entered the null,
all your spells would fall apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. New spells wouldn&rsquo;t work. Spells in place would
be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not understand and said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A simple glamor will fade on entering the null. It is
being actively maintained. A spell which changes and leaves
changed, but which isn&rsquo;t active on entering the null,
won&rsquo;t be affected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something off in the badlands of my mind tickled me. I could not
run it down. &ldquo;If you turned into a frog and hopped in there,
you&rsquo;d stay a frog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the transformation was actual and not just an
illusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; I hung a red flag on that, told me to worry
it later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will become a companion acquired along the way. Say,
someone who can help with your documents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had to be levels of deceit. Or something. I could not
imagine her putting her life into my hands. I do believe I
gawked.</p>

<p>She nodded. &ldquo;You begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You
trust me too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you better than you know
yourself. You&rsquo;re an honorable man, by your own lights, with
enough cynicism to believe there can be a lesser of two evils. You
have been under the Eye.&rdquo; I shuddered. She did not apologize.
We both knew an apology would be false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure why you want to do this. It makes no
sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a new situation in the world. Once there were
only two poles, your peasant girl and I, with a line of conflict
drawn between. But that which stirs in the north adds another
point. It can be seen as a lengthening of the line, with my point
near the middle, or as a triangle. The point that is my husband
intends destroying both your White Rose and myself. I submit that
she and I ought to eliminate the greater danger
before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough. I see. But I don&rsquo;t see Darling being that
pragmatic. There&rsquo;s a lot of hatred in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But it&rsquo;s worth a try. Will you
help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having been within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the old darkness and
seen the ghosts astalk on the Barrowland, yes, I would do most
anything to keep that dread spook from shedding his grave. But how,
how, how trust her!</p>

<p>She did that trick they all have, of seeming to read my mind.
&ldquo;You will have me within the null.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;ll need to think some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your time. I can&rsquo;t leave for some time.&rdquo;
I suspect she wanted to establish safeguards against a palace
revolution.</p>
