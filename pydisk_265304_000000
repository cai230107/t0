<a id="p873" name="p873"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(873)">"This is the largest Reserve, isn't it?" Thad moved closer, his voice low, as if he shared my uneasiness and feared being overheard, while Emrys kept to the middle of the road a little behind.</p>
<a id="p874" name="p874"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(874)">"Yes. Anlav." I did not believe we need fear the animals. They kept mainly to the wildest parts of the Reserve, though I did not know about the mutants that had been housed here.</p>
<a id="p875" name="p875"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(875)">Anlav had once had top priority among the mutation labs. But that had been some years ago. The curtailing of such work had made them center on the Pilav Reserve for a time.</p>
<a id="p876" name="p876"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(876)">We rounded a curve to see the Ranger station. Like all such posts, it had been deliberately fashioned to blend in with the natural scenery. Its walls did not run straight but were made of rough stone unsmoothed. The roof had sod and vines planted on it, growing as if their support were a natural hillock, and the vehicle park was concealed by a brush wall.</p>
<a id="p877" name="p877"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(877)">I cupped my hand trumpet-fashion about my lips and gave the recognition call. But though we eyed the patch of dark that must be the door with growing impatience, there was no response. Now there was nothing but to cross the open.</p>
<a id="p878" name="p878"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(878)">If the force field was up, we would know it soon enough. Warning the boys, I took the lead, my hand outstretched as a warn-off. Animals coming against that screen suffered, I had been told, a mild shock. What effect it might have on a human I did not know.</p>
<a id="p879" name="p879"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(879)">But my hand met no barrier, and I came to the door, which stood a quarter open. The distrust of all about me grew with every step I took. Anlav was of such importance that the Ranger station should be manned at all times. What had happened here?</p>
<a id="p880" name="p880"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(880)">The door swung in at once under my touch. I crossed the threshold warily, coming into the main room. It followed the general pattern of such places, consisting of three rooms, the largest running the full length, a combination living-office space with a cook unit at the far end. To the back would lie a bunk room and, flanking it, a small lab and storage space.</p>
<a id="p881" name="p881"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(881)">I almost fell, for my eyes were bothered by the contrast between the light outside and this interior gloom. There was something on the floor to trip me. I switched on my belt torch and glanced down at a sheet of plasta, the kind generally used for storage protection. As I swept the light on around the room, I saw other signs of disorder. A chair had been pushed back so hurriedly that it had fallen on its back, and legs pointing at me like stunner barrels. There were dishes on the table with dried bits of food. And on the desk a com-ticker had gone on spewing forth report tape, which curled to the floor until the machine had finally run down.</p>
<a id="p882" name="p882"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(882)">The wall rack on which large-duty stunners usually rested was empty. There was a rustling as I approached the desk. A furred thing, moving too fast for me to get good sight of it, darted out from under that piece of furniture and scurried on through the door into the storeroom. The post had not only been left suddenly, but also some time ago.</p>
<a id="p883" name="p883"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(883)">I saw the control plate for the lights and passed my hand across it twice for the brightest beam.</p>
<a id="p884" name="p884"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(884)">Thad asked from the doorway, "No one here?"</p>
<a id="p885" name="p885"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(885)">I tried the bunk room. Small personal items were still on the hanging shelves there, and all four bunks were neatly made. Whatever had called the staff away, they had not packed. I made sure of this by trying the wall cupboards, peering at changes of uniform and underclothing.</p>
<a id="p886" name="p886"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(886)">The lab-storage was neat, but there were some signs of rummaging at floor level&#151;gnawed containers, rations spilled and half eaten out of them. I heard a warning snarl from behind one overturned box.</p>
<a id="p887" name="p887"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(887)">"They're gone," I answered Thad's question as I backed out of that room, not wanting to turn away from whatever might be hidden there. There are some small creatures that do not look menacing to the uninformed but are formidable if you underrate them.</p>
<a id="p888" name="p888"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(888)">There might be one possible answer. I crossed to the desk where the duty tape had twisted into coils on the floor. Though I could not judge the amount of use such a machine had in Anlav, I thought that more than one day, or perhaps two, had elapsed while the machine ground out unread reports. And there was no way of telling how long it had been since it ran down entirely.</p>
<a id="p889" name="p889"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(889)">The loops of tape were in code, but it was a simple one, for condensation only. I read it without trouble&#151;all routine dictation from Eye-Spies set up on feeding grounds and on game trails, reports of animal movements. There were two alarms about predators in grazing grounds, which would ordinarily have sent the Rangers on field duty out with a stunner.</p>
<a id="p890" name="p890"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(890)">"Com&#151;" Thad pointed to the other installation.</p>
<a id="p891" name="p891"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(891)">One stride brought me to it. When I picked up the hand mike, I could hear the unmistakable thrum-thrum of an open connection. But there was no other sound carrying through. I levered the visa-plate, but that remained blank. The broadcast did not come through.</p>
<a id="p892" name="p892"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(892)">"Call in!" Thad was beside me.</p>
<a id="p893" name="p893"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(893)">"Not yet." I put the mike down and fingered the button that broke the relay. "Not until we know more of who may be there&#151;"</p>
<a id="p894" name="p894"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(894)">For a moment it seemed he might question my decision, and then he nodded.</p>
<a id="p895" name="p895"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(895)">"Might be alerting those we wouldn't want to know&#151;"</p>
<a id="p896" name="p896"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(896)">"Just so. Let's look for a flitter."</p>
<a id="p897" name="p897"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(897)">What we found in the vehicle park were a ground car and a hopper. The former had its engine box open, and tools lay in disarray as if the one working on it had been hastily summoned elsewhere. Thad went to look at it.</p>
<a id="p898" name="p898"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(898)">"Putting in a new pick-up unit&#151;just needs the tri-hookup, but it's based."</p>
<a id="p899" name="p899"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(899)">Emrys had gone to the hopper, climbed in, and was gunning for a take-off before I could stop him. But there was no purr of answer. Perhaps both vehicles had been abandoned because they were useless for those in a hurry.</p>
<a id="p900" name="p900"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(900)">"Get out!" I snapped at Emrys. "Remember what we agreed&#151;go slow. We take a hopper, and we can be picked up on an income screen. If we use any transportation, it must be the ground car&#151;that has a distort shield."</p>
<a id="p901" name="p901"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(901)">"And," I added as he came out, his look sullen rather than contrite, "if you need action, get back to the bridge and bring the others in. It's going to rain and soon."</p>
<a id="p902" name="p902"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(902)">The brightness of the morning was gone. Clouds rolled dark and heavy, and one could almost drink the gathering moisture from the air. As he went, I turned to Thad and the land car. He was right. About two-thirds of the work on it had been done. It needed only the final connections. And if that was the only repair needed, once we had completed that we would have a mode of transportation far better suited to our purpose now than any far-ranging hopper or flitter. Though it traveled only at ground level, it was equipped with screens that distorted the vision of those without so that it was, for all purposes, invisible. It could not travel fast, but it would be able to move without detection, though a radar could pick up some hint of it. Meant to get close to the animals on the open grazing ranges, it would be a type of transport unknown to the refugees, if they were now our enemies.</p>
<a id="p903" name="p903"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(903)">"Close it up now," I told Thad. "We can't do anything until the rain is over. Let's hurry the rest along."</p>
<a id="p904" name="p904"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(904)">We did not beat the rain, for we were all wet through when we at last dodged into the post. I laid Dagny down on one of the inner bunks, and Thad quickly switched on the heat-dry unit. When we closed the door to the storm, we were well sheltered, even better than at the cave base.</p>
<a id="p905" name="p905"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(905)">"What happened here?" Annet looked at the dishes, the chair none of us had bothered to right, and the tangle of tape on the floor.</p>
<a id="p906" name="p906"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(906)">"The staff must have left in a hurry&#151;I don't know how long ago. Meanwhile, let's make sure we have no uninvited guests." Stunner in hand, I went into the lab-storage. I warned the others to keep outside and turned my weapon from maximum to low, since what I hunted was small enough to take refuge behind a box only knee high.</p>
<a id="p907" name="p907"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(907)">I gave a swift cross spray of the deadening ray and then pulled crates and boxes around until I discovered my quarry, lying limp, its sharply pointed nose turned up as it slept, if not peacefully, well.</p>
<a id="p908" name="p908"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(908)">It was an inflax, always a camp raider when it could get a chance, but not as harmless as it looked, for this was a male with the hollowed fangs for the irritating poison. I picked it up and laid it on a box top, while I searched for any other visitors. But this seemed to be alone. I carried it out and pointed to its armament in warning, then set it outside the door under an outcrop of the wall that would keep the worst of the storm from it. The outer air and the added whip of water would speedily awaken it.</p>
<a id="p909" name="p909"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(909)">Annet had found the com and changed the dial to the range of the port. I had just time to grab the mike from her hand.</p>
<a id="p910" name="p910"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(910)">"What do you&#151;" she began fiercely.</p>
<a id="p911" name="p911"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(911)">"We agreed&#151;no rash steps until we were sure!" I reminded her.</p>
<a id="p912" name="p912"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(912)">"We haven't time to poke and pry!" She tried to force the mike from me. "We have to get Dagny to the medico and as quickly as possible. If we call, they could send a flitter."</p>
<a id="p913" name="p913"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(913)">"First, try the incall." I thought that the fact I had not been able to pick up any broadcast might impress her. "Feeholme is the only settlement this side of the mountains. Try that!"</p>
<a id="p914" name="p914"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(914)">I gave the mike to her and clicked on the proper relays. If there was any broadcasting, we could pick up the chatter, even if our wave was not narrowed to either call or reception. Again we could hear the thrum of an open beam but no whisper along it. Once more I dialed for receive, taking a chance to do so much, my hand ready to break connection instantly were we to attract the sort of attention we did not want. But the sound of the system was all that came to me.</p>
<a id="p915" name="p915"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(915)">Annet stared at the mike in her hand and stooped to read the symbol above the switch I had activated.</p>
<a id="p916" name="p916"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(916)">"I don't understand. They should be on the air. At this hour there would not just be an open circuit and no broadcast."</p>
<a id="p917" name="p917"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(917)">"Unless there was no one there&#151;"</p>
<a id="p918" name="p918"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(918)">She shook her head violently, not only in denial of my suggestion, I thought, but also against her own fears.</p>
<a id="p919" name="p919"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(919)">"But the com is <i>never</i> untended. Try the distress call&#151;"</p>
<a id="p920" name="p920"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(920)">"No. Listen, Annet. If Lugard was right, we could trigger worse than what we have now. We agreed not to rush blindly. There is a ground car here. They were repairing it when they left, but I can finish off their job as soon as the weather clears a little. Ground cars may be slow, but they have protection which may be of benefit to us. I promise you, as soon as we can use it, we'll take off for Feeholme. And from there a lift over the mountains is nothing. But tell me, does this suggest to you that a normal state of affairs exists?" I indicated the room. "And when they left, they took all the armament this station had."</p>
<a id="p921" name="p921"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(921)">"All right. But as soon as we can&#151;"</p>
<a id="p922" name="p922"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(922)">"We'll go," I promised her.</p>
<a id="p923" name="p923"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(923)">She moved away from the com and stooped to pick up the chair to set it straight again. Then she was at the cook unit, opening the supply cupboard above it, while I went to search the desk for any hint of what had happened here. There was nothing but routine record tapes. The tape from the floor, though I gave it more detailed study now, also held nothing but reports from the Reserve.</p>
<a id="p924" name="p924"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(924)">The force of the storm lessened by midafternoon. As soon as we could venture out, Thad and I were back at the ground car. He proved knowledgeable and was the kind of co-worker one could wish for. But since neither of us was trained as a tech, we were not as swift about it as we might have been. We had no more than made the last connection and slammed down the cover, than a second storm was upon us, driving us to shelter in the post.</p>
<a id="p925" name="p925"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(925)">That was a wild night. Perhaps our sojourn underground made it seem twice as bad as it might have otherwise. I had a sudden idea to fit another tape in the general report and click it on, centering its attention to details of what might be happening on the road between us and Feeholme.</p>
<a id="p926" name="p926"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(926)">It clicked away steadily, grinding out code for downed trees, overflow of some streams, animals fleeing before the lash of wind and rain. And as the worst of these possible delays were noted, I marked them in turn on a map from the desk so that we would have preparation for trouble the next day.</p>
<a id="p927" name="p927"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(927)">We started shortly after dawn. It was a wet world that faced us, but the violence of yesterday was passed. The ground car had been intended to carry equipment throughout the Reserve, and by stripping it of all but the seats, we had room for the whole party within it. I did not yet activate the distort, since I must save that for the approach to Feeholme.</p>
<a id="p928" name="p928"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(928)">The road was gullied and puddled, but the treads of the car were meant to take worse than that smoothly. We ground on at a steady pace. Twice we had to detour around fallen trees, and once there were a few anxious moments when we forded a stream and the storm-swollen waters lashed around the sturdy body of the vehicle as high as the seats within, sending a few trickles about the doors to wet our feet. But I went at a slant, more with the current than directly across, and the treads bit and pulled us up on comparatively dry land.</p>
<a id="p929" name="p929"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(929)">We caught sight of animals but always at a distance. At noon we pulled into the lee of a high rock spur that was capped with a pickup rod, one of the link of supervisory contacts across the Reserve. There was no sign anyone had been there, though one of the guidelines for the pickup had broken and whacked against the rod in the pull of the wind.</p>
<a id="p930" name="p930"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(930)">Annet, however, had no eyes for what was around us in the wilderness, for she had at last won a small response from Dagny, who asked for water. Not that she seemed aware of those around her, but as we ate, she sucked from an E-tube, and it was not necessary to squeeze it into her mouth and then try to get her to swallow.</p>
<a id="p931" name="p931"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(931)">I thought we might make it by dark and began to prepare Annet now for the further precautions I wanted to take when we reached there. When I spoke of halting the car, leaving them in it in distort while I scouted, she seemed amiable, but it was as if she humored me, not that she believed it necessary.</p>
<a id="p932" name="p932"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(932)">Feeholme I had seen only once, and then it had been an in-and-out visit, a point of departure and change from the flitter that had brought me with two other Ranger candidates from the port to the hopper that carried us into the Reserve. It was larger than Kynvet because it was the only settlement this side of the mountains. But it was no more than a village probably when compared to towns off-world. It was the headquarters for Rangers.</p>
<a id="p933" name="p933"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(933)">We crawled on, and I kept an anxious eye on the gauges. The worry over the reason for the half-repaired engine was always at the back of my mind. If transportation failed us here, it might be grave. But so far there were no signs of trouble.</p>
<a id="p934" name="p934"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(934)">Twilight came early as clouds were massing again, and I put on what speed I could to race another storm. We came to the foot of a rise, and there I turned off the road, creeping into a small copse of trees and through that to the ravine they guarded. There were rocks here to form a natural wall, and I backed the car against that. If the others kept inside, they would have the best protection I could find from any gale.</p>
<a id="p935" name="p935"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(935)">I did not take anything with me save the stunner, and it was my hope that somehow, somewhere, I would find a replacement for that, a weapon of greater power. I made Annet promise to keep the lights off while I was gone, while Thad took my seat at the controls with orders to switch on the distort as soon as I was out of range.</p>
<a id="p936" name="p936"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(936)">Then I moved up the rise. When I turned to look back, it was as if the car had vanished, and I knew a small lift of relief. They were safe as long as they stayed inside that.</p>
<a id="p937" name="p937"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(937)">There was no reason to return to the road. I cut across country, where there was more cover. Below now I could see the dark blot of Feeholme, a very dark blot for not a single light showed, and that was an immediate warning of trouble.</p>
<a id="p938" name="p938"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(938)">The country around the settlement had been cleared of the thicker growth of trees and underbrush, leaving only enough to please the eye and give shade. Here the houses and the headquarters buildings were not set off by themselves but around an oval, the center point of which was a landing place for flitters and hoppers. I did not know the exact population, but I thought that those dark buildings should shelter at least two hundred. In addition to the Reserve headquarters, there was a shopping center, which had once sold off-world products but now served as an exchange for the output of various other labs and settlements&#151;for there was a small trade in specialties from different sectors. Each of the settlements was practically self-sufficient, however&#151;a reason for the dwindling interest in off-world trade, which had not, after the first ten years of pioneering, ever supplied more than luxuries and exotics.</p>
<a id="p939" name="p939"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(939)">I came now to cultivated fields, drawing back to leap the safe-current&#151;until I saw that there was no thin blue radiance stringing from post to post. A branch pushed forward to where the current should run did not shrivel. The protection for the crops, already near harvesting, had not been activated. I saw a small herd of verken taking advantage of that. Judging by the extent of trampled and eaten plants, I guessed that this had not been their first visit here.</p>
<a id="p940" name="p940"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(940)">They snorted, snuffled, and scattered at my coming, but they did not pursue their loping run far, facing about to see if I would give chase. When I did not, they shuffled back for such a feast as they had probably never known before.</p>
<a id="p941" name="p941"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(941)">Dark houses, inactive field protection&#151;it added up in a way I did not like. Then I came upon a hopper, well off the road, its nose slammed into a wall until the front was crumpled. I flashed my torch into the cabin, then flicked it off and tried to erase from my mind what that instant of light had shown me. But having seen it, I came directly into the open. <i>That</i> would not have been there had there been anyone left in Feeholme to care.</p>
<a id="p942" name="p942"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(942)">So I tried the first house and again found&#151;No, a single glance was enough to send me out faster than I had entered. But there was still the headquarters, and perhaps I could discover something there, if only a hint on a message tape. There were others who had died in the open. And there were scavengers from the Reserve come to feast. I avoided what I could. But I had to step over part of a skeleton to enter the building I sought. There I found men who must have died at their posts in the com room and elsewhere, but nowhere any sign of what had come so suddenly to end a settlement almost a hundred planet years old.</p>
<a id="p943" name="p943"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(943)">I made myself examine some of the dead. There were no wounds or laser burns. It would seem that these had simply fallen at their duties and died, perhaps in a matter of seconds.</p>
<a id="p944" name="p944"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(944)">Gas? But what of those in the open? Or had they been the stronger and managed to crawl as far before collapse came? I could not account for such wholesale slaughter by any weapon that I knew.</p>
<a id="p945" name="p945"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(945)">The off-worlders might have such. We had heard rumors of all types of things developed for the exploitation of enemy planets, things that would remove a population and leave their world empty. Had the refugees put into service such a one here&#151;perhaps trying it out before they turned pirate as Lugard had foretold some of the remnants of the tattered fleets would do? But why such wanton slaughter?</p>
<a id="p946" name="p946"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(946)">I stood in the com room. The circuits were still open as they had been when a dead or dying hand slipped from the control board. I saw the steady light of clear channel on the board. Stepping closer, I read the symbol for Haychax over the mountains. But all that came through the amplifier was the same thrum-thrum we had picked up at the Ranger station.</p>
<a id="p947" name="p947"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(947)">At any rate, this town could give us no aid. And I was not about to lead our party into what lay here. But I did search for weapons. In the end, I found three more stunners and one long-shot laser meant for ground clearing, but that was too bulky to transport, and when I turned it on, the glow was so reduced that I knew it near extinction. The fact that in a settlement that supplied three Reserves these were all to be found in the way of arms was another disturbing point. It would seem there had been other searchers before me. When I came into the store place, I found evidence of that.</p>
<a id="p948" name="p948"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(948)">I faced wild confusion. Boxes and containers had been ripped open and much of their content wastefully spilled and trampled. The tracks in some of the wastage were signature enough to tell me that no Beltane settler had done this, for two or three boot prints were so clearly marked that there could be no mistaking&#151;space boots. The looters must have been from the refugee camp. Had they also caused the death of the town? I went down on hands and knees and tested with fingertip the leakage of a broken canister and decided it had begun perhaps only a day earlier, while the town had met its fate long before that&#151;perhaps even on the same day we had gone underground, or shortly thereafter.</p>
<a id="p949" name="p949"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(949)">Now I foraged in what was left, finding a drop bag meant to be parachuted to Rangers in the Reserve where there was no landing place. Into that I packed small cans and ration tubes. We had brought little enough out of the caves, and if we had to stay away from settlements, we would need all we could find.</p>
<a id="p950" name="p950"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(950)">It was too heavy to shoulder when I left, so I had to drag it after me, but it had been made for hard usage, and I did not worry. I had come out of another door into the landing place of the settlement. Here again was a scene of wanton destruction. I dared to use my torch, though only in quick flashes. What I saw were burned flitters, at least two of them. Half a dozen hoppers had been worked over with lasers until they were masses of half-melted metal. There was not one remaining unwrecked transport.</p>
<a id="p951" name="p951"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(951)">I had seen enough of Feeholme&#151;the tomb that Feeholme had become. There were two other Ranger stations on this side of the mountains, but I doubted whether we could find help at either. And if we returned to Kynvet, it would only be by taking the car as far as we could run it, then hiking over the mountains on our feet. But perhaps there was no reason for such a return&#151;</p>
<a id="p952" name="p952"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(952)">Dragging my pack of supplies, I went back across the fields. I was in the shadow of a copse of trees when I saw a spark in the sky. It was well away from Feeholme, but it was no star&#151;rather the light of a flitter. Its course was erratic, moving up and down, side to side, as if whatever hand lay on the controls was either inexperienced or under some difficulty. I headed to where I had left the car, and I hoped that those I had left there would not strive to signal the pilot. What I had seen here made me more determined than ever that we must keep our guard.</p>
<a id="p953" name="p953"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(953)">Rain broke then, cold and heavy, and I found the bag a greater weight as I struggled up the rise. I could no longer see the light of the flitter. There was a roll of thunder and clashes of violet lightning, which made me flinch involuntarily and try to run.</p>
