FOR CHRIST'S SAKE by Newton Joseph, Ph.D.

What Chutzpah, that 2 billion Christians think that Jesus Christ is listening to their everyday personal prayers. How can he, when he has so much work to do running this universe? Don’t you think that those who pray to god to win football games, lotteries, finding a lost dog trivialize prayers? Does Jesus want to be a 911 number? Can he respond to those two billon Christians within a reasonable period of time to win that football game or find that lost dog before it is run over by a car? Can Jehovah the god of the Jews meet the needs of those Jews who pray in front of the Wailing Wall? You can be sure Jesus the god of all Christians will NOT be at the Wailing Wall. (Wrong God).

Is it not myopic? To think that the god Jesus is hovering around Christians waiting for some kind of intervention? (Oomph's, I forgot he is omnipresent) can an omnipresent god keep all those prayers to him separate?

I understand the psychology of prayers.(word magic) I have written about it before so I will not go into detail. Prays are a form of catharsis, it is self. self-expression to an imaginary figure who will not interrupt you when you are expressing yourself, and of course "he" is at your service at all times(no appointment necessary). It is the same as talking to yourself.

A conversation between you and the god of your choice. I am not knocking catharsis; it is a natural and valuable way to lesson emotional pain (anxiety).  However in order to have mental health it is always best to talk to a real person who can give you reasonable and rational feedback.
