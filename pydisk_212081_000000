<h2 class="chapter">46</h2>

<p>One-Eye was a prophet. Although I did want to know. And thanks
to the Nyueng Bao I heard a story.</p>

<p>The light across town faded. The attendant racket subsided. Part
of that drifted toward the hills. The rest fell back toward
Mogaba&rsquo;s part of town.</p>

<p>The crackle of small sorceries rippled across the plain. The
whole expanse glistened silver. &ldquo;That was a strange one.
One-Eye, what say we build a watchtower on top of one of the
enfilading towers? That way we could get high enough to see what
Mogaba and Spinner are doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got Nyueng Bao to spy for you over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t ask you to do any work
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea sounds a lot better already. But I still think
the Nyueng Bao could be your eyes, you play it right. You
don&rsquo;t need to get as paranoid as Croaker. Just look at what
they bring you so you see whose purpose it might serve. Consider
what might be missing the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;m as lazy as you are,&rdquo; I told
One-Eye. &ldquo;Only with me it&rsquo;s mental. That sounds like a
lot of thinking. And I&rsquo;d rather see stuff with my own eyes
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like the Old Man,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;You got
to read them Annals all the time, how about you read some that was
written by somebody besides Croaker? I was looking forward to a
little relief from his righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we were back to the black-market bread scheme.</p>

<p>Goblin turned up. &ldquo;Pretty exciting stuff happening over
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah? Like what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got up on the wall over there. For a while.
Mogaba&rsquo;s guys weren&rsquo;t worried about getting caught
letting me peek. He led this raid in person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just tell us about it,&rdquo; One-Eye grumbled.
&ldquo;You all the time got to flap on about stuff
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Awk!&rdquo; A huge bug landed in
One-Eye&rsquo;s mouth. Goblin&rsquo;s smirk hinted that he might
have been involved in the insect&rsquo;s errant navigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Doj character can tell you more than me. Some of his
guys snuck out there behind Mogaba&rsquo;s gang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mogaba was trying to bushwhack Spinner. But he
stumbled into Lady instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shitting
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When that bunch of flareballs went up? There she was. Her
and about fifteen guys. They were right outside the camp gate,
practically crawling over Mogaba&rsquo;s mob. Least that&rsquo;s
what I heard. I didn&rsquo;t see it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So
where&rsquo;s Uncle Doj?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably checking in with
the Speaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably. &ldquo;Yeah? Look, we&rsquo;ve got a
bunch of deserters from the First. See if some will sneak back to
find out more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes chunky boy now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked right in front of Thai Dei, like he was deaf. Or like
we didn&rsquo;t care squat what he heard.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj brought a couple other Nyueng Bao. They surrounded
another chunky boy, this one a wide little Taglian. He seemed more
prisoner than companion though no weapons were in evidence.</p>

<p>It amazed me that Uncle Doj could climb to the ramparts without
breathing hard. Maybe he used some wild sorcery that stole
Wheezer&rsquo;s breath.</p>

<p>That sounded like something out of the Gunni myth book.
&ldquo;What have you got, Uncle?&rdquo; I stared at the squat
Taglian. He was indifferent to my gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An outsider. The Speaker sent Banh and Binh to watch the
black men, who wanted to attack the Shadowmaster himself. But they
ran into others from the outside pursuing a similar goal. This one
left his party and joined those running for the wall when the
flares went up. The outsider group may have been betrayed
intentionally so this one could become separated in the
confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I continued to study the outsider. He was a Gunni, more stockily
built than anyone in these parts. Maybe he worked at that. He
seemed possessed of a powerful arrogance.</p>

<p>I asked, &ldquo;Is there anything special about him?&rdquo;
Uncle Doj seemed strongly interested in him, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He bears the mark of Khadi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That took a moment. Oh. Yeah. In the books from the catacombs.
Khadi was an alternate or regional name for Kina. There were quite
a few of those. &ldquo;If you say so. I don&rsquo;t see it myself.
Point it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Doj&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. He drew a deep breath,
exasperated. &ldquo;Even now you refuse to reveal yourself, Soldier
of Darkness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even now I don&rsquo;t have any fucking idea what
you&rsquo;re raving about. I am tired of hearing it.&rdquo; I was
developing suspicions, though. &ldquo;Instead of sputtering and
fussing and offering cryptic grumbles why don&rsquo;t you say
something I can understand? Pretend I&rsquo;m what I say I am and
can&rsquo;t call down the lightning to part your hair. Who is this
guy? Who do you think I am? Come on, Uncle. Talk to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a slave of Khadi.&rdquo; Uncle Doj glared at me,
daring me not to understand that. He did not want to be more
explicit.</p>

<p>That made no sense to me. But I am not a superstitious man. Did
he believe his one mouth had the power to raise the she-devil
alone? &ldquo;Kina must be one badass bitch,&rdquo; I told One-Eye.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got Uncle drizzling down his leg. You. You got a
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Sindhu. I am of the staff of the warrior woman you
call Lady. I was sent to observe the situation here.&rdquo; He
continued to meet my gaze. His eyes were colder than any
lizard&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable enough.&rdquo; If taken with a block of
salt. &ldquo;Lady? This is the Lady who was second in command in
the Black Company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Lady. The goddess has smiled upon her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked Uncle Doj, &ldquo;Is he a liaison man, then? Between us
and Lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may tell you so. But he is a spy for the toog. He will
not speak truth when a lie will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle, old buddy, you and me and the old man need to sit
down and try to talk the same language for a while. What do you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Doj grunted. Which could mean anything. &ldquo;The toog
will not speak truth when a lie will do.&rdquo; Sindhu was
amused.</p>

<p>The man struck me as a complete false face. I said,
&ldquo;Goblin, find this guy some place to sleep.&rdquo; I shifted
languages. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let him out of your sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have chores enough already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s sight. All right? I don&rsquo;t like him
at all. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to like him even this
much tomorrow morning. He smells like trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One-Eye agreed. &ldquo;Big trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just chuck his hairy ass off the wall,
then?&rdquo; Goblin can be pragmatic in the extreme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I want to find out more about him. I think
we&rsquo;ve crawled right up to the edge of the mystery that has
hung us up ever since we got here. Let him run free. We&rsquo;ll
play dumb and keep track of every breath he takes.&rdquo; I was
sure I could count on the Speaker&rsquo;s help with that.</p>

<p>My two wizards scowled and grumbled. Hard to blame them. They
always end up carrying the load.</p>
