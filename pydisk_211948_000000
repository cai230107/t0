<h2 class="chapter">XLIX</h2>

<p>Toadkiller Dog was amused by his companions in misfortune, so
eager to spend themselves in the digging yet so loath to do what
had to be done to ensure their strength. After four days of
increasing hunger he killed the weakest. He fed, and left the
remains to the others. It did not take them long to overcome their
reservations and revulsion. And that quickened their determination.
None wanted to be next on the menu.</p>

<p>But the digging took another eight days.</p>

<p>Only the monster himself came up out of the earth. But that
would have been the case had the digging taken only an hour.</p>

<p>He escaped the darkness of underground into the darkness of
night. The trail was not hard to find, It had not rained since the
hour of the Limper&rsquo;s perfidy. Ha! Headed north again!</p>

<p>He began to trot. As he loosened up he stretched himself more
and more, till he fell into a lupine lope that left a dozen leagues
behind him every hour. He did not break stride till he had crossed
the bounds of the empire and had come to the place where the Limper
had encountered a major obstacle. He stopped. He prowled and
sniffed till he understood what had happened.</p>

<p>The Limper had not been welcomed back with tears of joy.</p>

<p>He caught something on the breeze, cast about, spied a distant
black rider armed with a flaming spear. The rider flung that
blazing dart northward.</p>

<p>Puzzled, Toadkiller Dog resumed his journey.</p>

<p>He came to another place where the Limper had had difficulties.
Again he saw a black rider with a fiery spear who hurled his dart
to the north.</p>

<p>One more repetition and the monster understood that he was being
encouraged to overtake the Limper, that he would be guided to the
inevitable confrontation, and that the Limper was being stalled all
along his northward journey.</p>

<p>What could he do when he caught up? He was no match for that son
of the shadow.</p>

<p>A black rider sat outside the gate of Beryl. He threw a blazing
spear to the east. Toadkiller Dog turned. He found the trail
quickly.</p>

<p>So. The old doom had been forced to take the long road, around
the sea. He loped on, gaining two miles for each three he ran. He
swam the River Bigotes and the Hyclades and streaked across the
seventy silvery miles of lifeless, mirror-flat salt desert called
the Rani Poor. He raced between the countless burial mounds of
Barbara to reach the forgotten highways of Laba Larada. He circled
the haunted ruins of Khun, passed the pyramids of Katch, which
still stood sentinel over the Canyons of the Undead. Warily, he
circled the remnants of the temple city of Marsha the Devastator,
where the air still shimmered with the cries of sacrificies whose
hearts had been torn out on the altars of an aloof and disdainful
goddess.</p>

<p>The trail grew warmer by the hour.</p>

<p>He came into the province of Karsus, past outposts of the empire
where auxiliaries recruited from the Grain tribes guarded the
frontier against the depredations of their own kind more
ferociously and faithfully than did the imperial legions. A black
rider armed with a spear of fire watched him race across the Plain
of Dano-Patha, where a hundred armies had contested the right of
passage north or south or east and where some legends said the Last
Battle of Time would be fought between Light and Darkness.</p>

<p>The Mountains of Sinjian lay beyond, and in their savage defiles
he found evidence that the Limper was again being tormented and
delayed, again with vicious traps narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>The spoor was heavy and hot and had the taint of newly opened
graves.</p>

<p>He came out onto a prominence overlooking the Straits of Angine,
where the fresh waters flowed down from the Kiril Lakes to meld
with the salty waters of the Sea of Torments. His vantage was not
far from that narrowest part of the strait that seafarers called
Hell&rsquo;s Gate and overland travelers had dubbed Heaven&rsquo;s
Bridge.</p>

<p>Hell was in session down there.</p>

<p>The Limper was on the south shore and wanted to cross over. But
on the north shore someone demurred.</p>

<p>Toadkiller Dog settled on his belly, rested his chin on his
forepaws, and watched. This was not the place to reveal himself.
Maybe at the Tower, if the Limper turned west and sought a
vengeance there.</p>

<p>As though they sensed his arrival, those who held the north
shore closed up shop and hauled out. The Limper hurled glamorous
violences after them. The distance was too great to do them any
harm.</p>

<p>The Limper went across immediately. He encountered traps
immediately. Toadkiller Dog decided he would hazard a more
difficult crossing. After dark.</p>

<p>There was no need to hurry now. He had the quarry in sight. He
could bide his time.</p>

<p>He might range ahead and lie in wait. Or he might stalk the
enemies of his enemy in order to discover the nature of their
game.</p>
