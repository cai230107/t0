<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_8"></a><b>Chapter 8</b></h1>
<a id="p963" name="p963"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(963)">"What did you think he would do, Venandakatra?" snarled Lord Tathagata. "Curry the great Skandagupta's favor by carving off the nose of the Ranapur dog with his own sword? Rape the dog's bitches in public?"</p>
<a id="p964" name="p964"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(964)">The high commander of the Malwa army drew himself up in his chair. "The man is a <i>general</i>, you fool. Not a mahamimamsa." Haughtily: "I would have done the same myself."</p>
<a id="p965" name="p965"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(965)">From the distance of his position, seated with the lesser officials to one side, Rana Sanga examined the heavy figure of Lord Tathagata. The high commander, along with the Empire's other top officers and highest officials, was ranged in a semicircle of chairs facing the Emperor on his throne.</p>
<a id="p966" name="p966"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(966)">Stinking liar, he thought. You would have cheerfully tortured the lord of Ranapur. And raped his wife as well as his daughter. And his sons, too, for that matter. Assuming, of course, that you could have managed an erection.&#160;</p>
<a id="p967" name="p967"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(967)">Nothing of these thoughts showed on his face, but Sanga found the sight of Lord Tathagata so repugnant that he looked away. In his opinion, Tathagata was no improvement over Lord Harsha. Slightly less incompetent perhaps, as a general; but even more vile, as a man.</p>
<a id="p968" name="p968"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(968)">His gaze fell on Lord Jivita, the Malwa empire's second-ranked military officer&#151;briefly, then slid away. Jivita was cut from the same cloth. He transferred the gaze to a man seated at the very end of that little row. Here, his eyes lingered. Of all the Malwa kshatriya<i> </i>who monopolized the top military positions in the Malwa Empire, Lord Damodara was the only one for whom Sanga felt genuine respect.</p>
<a id="p969" name="p969"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(969)">The Rajput looked away, sighing faintly. Unfortunately, for all his ability, Damodara was only distantly related to the Emperor. Sanga was surprised, actually, that Damodara had even managed to reach his current position&#151;ranked sixth in the army, as Malwa reckoned such things. He would rise no further, unless unexpected casualties or military disasters overwhelmed the Malwa dynastic sensibilities.</p>
<a id="p970" name="p970"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(970)">Which they might, he mused, when we attack Persia and Rome. Especially if&#151;&#160;</p>
<a id="p971" name="p971"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(971)">To his surprise, he heard his name spoken. By Lord Damodara.</p>
<a id="p972" name="p972"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(972)">"I would like to hear Rana Sanga's opinion on this matter. Other than Lord Venandakatra, he has had far more contact with this Belisarius than any of us. And he is a general himself, with great military accomplishments to his credit."</p>
<a id="p973" name="p973"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(973)">Spluttering, Venandakatra began to squawk outrage at the idea of calling for the opinion of mere Rajput in such august company, but the Emperor himself called him short.</p>
<a id="p974" name="p974"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(974)">"Be silent, Venandakatra!" grumbled Skandagupta. "I myself would like to hear Rana Sanga's opinion."</p>
<a id="p975" name="p975"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(975)">Venandakatra, abashed, slunk back to his chair.</p>
<a id="p976" name="p976"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(976)">Rana Sanga advanced to the center of the pavilion. After prostrating himself before the Emperor, he rose and stepped back a few paces, so that he could be seen by both the Emperor and his top advisers.</p>
<a id="p977" name="p977"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(977)">"What is your opinion, then?" repeated Damodara.</p>
<a id="p978" name="p978"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(978)">Sanga hesitated for a split second. Then, squaring his shoulders, spoke firmly. He was a Rajput.</p>
<a id="p979" name="p979"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(979)">"I do not see where Belisarius could have acted in any other manner. For three reasons." <i>If it's to be done, do it well. </i>"First, his honor. No general worthy of the name can allow his honor to be sullied. To have tortured the prisoners, under those circumstances&#151;even to have ordered his soldiers to do so&#151;would have been to stoop to the level of&#151;" <i>Careful. They cherish their filthy mahamimansa</i>. "&#151;a mere servant. A menial. You might as well have asked him to clean the Emperor's stables."</p>
<a id="p980" name="p980"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(980)">He paused. Nods of agreement came from the Malwa.</p>
<a id="p981" name="p981"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(981)">"Two. His reputation. On the other hand, for him to have refused to deal with the prisoners would have sullied his reputation for decisiveness, determination, and willingness to spill blood. No general can allow such a stain on his reputation. Certainly not one such as Belisarius who, if some of you are not aware, has a towering reputation in his own land. And the lands of his enemies."</p>
<a id="p982" name="p982"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(982)">Pause. Hesitant nods, now, from most of the Malwa except Damodara and two or three others. It was obvious that few of them had made the effort to learn anything about Belisarius, even though much information was readily available from the excellent Malwa espionage apparatus.</p>
<a id="p983" name="p983"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(983)">"For him to have refused to execute the prisoners would have imputed a lack of willpower. A tendency to shrink from necessary action, to waver in the face of carnage."</p>
<a id="p984" name="p984"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(984)">The nods were no longer hesitant. Malwa officials needed no explanation of the value of a reputation for ruthlessness.</p>
<a id="p985" name="p985"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(985)">"Three. His valor."</p>
<a id="p986" name="p986"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(986)">Here, he lost them completely, except&#151;he thought&#151;for Damodara. Sanga took a breath, elaborated:</p>
<a id="p987" name="p987"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(987)">"It is that valor which explains the abrupt manner of the execution, and the&#151;otherwise inexcusable&#151;manner in which it was done. The failure to warn Lord Venandakatra and other officials, or to turn the prisoners aside so that the blood of rebels would not pollute the worthy. The&#151;" <i>Maintain a respectful face. Do it.</i> "&#151;utterly disgraceful lack of respect shown to the Emperor's Ye-tai bodyguards."</p>
<a id="p988" name="p988"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(988)">He paused, scanned his audience. They were still completely at a loss. Sanga sighed, took a deep breath, explained the obvious:</p>
<a id="p989" name="p989"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(989)">"You cannot place a man like Belisarius in such a position and expect that he will react in any way other than one which demonstrates, for all to see, that he is fearless and ferocious. Lord Venandakatra chose to place General Belisarius in a situation which clearly expressed contempt for him. That was a mistake. A man like Belisarius will no more tolerate contempt than would a tiger."</p>
<a id="p990" name="p990"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(990)">Dawning comprehension, still faint. Sanga put it as simply as possible:</p>
<a id="p991" name="p991"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(991)">"My Lords. Great Emperor. You can, if you choose, bait a tiger in a cage to see if he has claws. If you do so, however, make sure to use a long stick."</p>
<a id="p992" name="p992"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(992)">All the officials laughed, now, except Venandakatra. Venandakatra began to bestow a baleful glare upon the Rajput until, out of the corner of his eye, he saw that the Emperor was laughing also. Rana Sanga, fascinated despite himself, watched the struggle on Venandakatra's face between instinctive malice and calculating self-interest.</p>
<a id="p993" name="p993"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(993)">Self-interest won. Venandakatra joined in the laughter, and made a small self-deprecating gesture. Then he arose and said:</p>
<a id="p994" name="p994"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(994)">"I agree with Rana Sanga. Many times I have told you of this man's mettle. Perhaps now you will listen." Again, the little self-deprecating gesture. "I should have listened to my voice, myself. I fear I allowed your skepticism to infect me."</p>
<a id="p995" name="p995"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(995)">His little laugh now had more substance, having scored his own point. Venandakatra smiled ruefully, nodded graciously at the Rajput, and said:</p>
<a id="p996" name="p996"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(996)">"My thanks, Rana Sanga, for reminding me of the dangers of tiger-baiting. I assure you, next time I will use a <i>very </i>long stick."</p>
<a id="p997" name="p997"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(997)">It was a dismissal. Relieved, Sanga began to turn away. Then, reminding himself of his own honor, he turned back.</p>
<a id="p998" name="p998"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(998)"><i>I swore an oath.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p999" name="p999"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(999)">"I must also say that&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1000" name="p1000"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1000)">"That's enough, Sanga!" snapped Lord Tathagata. The Malwa commander had enjoyed Venandakatra's discomfiture, but&#151;the fellow was a mere Rajput, when all was said and done.</p>
<a id="p1001" name="p1001"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1001)">Sanga stood motionless.</p>
<a id="p1002" name="p1002"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1002)">"<i>Enough,</i>" growled Tathagata.</p>
<a id="p1003" name="p1003"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1003)">Sanga shrugged, ever so slightly, prostrated himself again before the Emperor, and resumed his seat toward the rear.</p>
<a id="p1004" name="p1004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1004)">Tathagata began to speak, but Damodara interrupted.</p>
<a id="p1005" name="p1005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1005)">"Might I suggest, noble Malwa, that we take a short break for refreshment? We are all a bit fatigued."</p>
<a id="p1006" name="p1006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1006)">Tathagata glanced at the Emperor. Skandagupta nodded, made a gesture.</p>
<a id="p1007" name="p1007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1007)">"Very well. We will resume in an hour."</p>
<a id="p1008" name="p1008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1008)">Outside the pavilion, where he had stepped for a breath of air, Sanga was shortly joined by Damodara.</p>
<a id="p1009" name="p1009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1009)">"Tell me," commanded the Malwa lord.</p>
<a id="p1010" name="p1010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1010)">Sanga sighed. He had been half-hoping that Damodara would ask. And half-dreading it.</p>
<a id="p1011" name="p1011"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1011)"><i>I swore an oath.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1012" name="p1012"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1012)">"Speak bluntly, Sanga. You need not fear repercussions. Not from me."</p>
<a id="p1013" name="p1013"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1013)">The Rajput stared down at the short, plump officer. By Malwa standards, Damodara was young for a top commander. In his late thirties, perhaps. But, like all members of the dynasty destined by birth for high command, he was no warrior. Still&#151;</p>
<a id="p1014" name="p1014"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1014)"><i>I swore an oath.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1015" name="p1015"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1015)">"Venandakatra has completely misunderstood Belisarius, Lord Damodara. This entire discussion"&#151;he gestured toward the pavilion&#151;"is a farce."</p>
<a id="p1016" name="p1016"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1016)">Damodara was frowning. Not with anger, simply concentration.</p>
<a id="p1017" name="p1017"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1017)">"Explain."</p>
<a id="p1018" name="p1018"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1018)">"There is not the slightest chance that Belisarius will betray Rome."</p>
<a id="p1019" name="p1019"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1019)">Damodara's eyes widened. He took a half-step back. Sanga drove on.</p>
<a id="p1020" name="p1020"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1020)">"He is playing Venandakatra for a fool.<i> </i>He has no intention of giving his allegiance to Malwa. He is simply insinuating himself into our graces as far as possible, in order to steal as many of our secrets as he can before returning to Rome."</p>
<a id="p1021" name="p1021"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1021)">Damodara looked away, tugging thoughtfully on his beard.</p>
<a id="p1022" name="p1022"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1022)">"You think&#151;how do you know? Has he said anything to you?"</p>
<a id="p1023" name="p1023"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1023)">Sanga shook his head. "It's nothing that he's ever said. But I know that man, Lord Damodara. Treason is not within his nature."</p>
<a id="p1024" name="p1024"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1024)">Damodara bestowed a quick, shrewd glance at Sanga. For all his Malwa upbringing, he knew something of the Rajput code. He did not share that code&#151;no Malwa did&#151;but, unlike most, he at least understood it. Damodara's lips quirked.</p>
<a id="p1025" name="p1025"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1025)">"Yet, by your own words, you say that Belisarius would not stoop to the work of menials. Now you claim that a general is willing to act as a spy."</p>
<a id="p1026" name="p1026"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1026)">Sanga shrugged. "His honor is not the same as mine&#151;as ours. I do not know Romans well, but enough to know that they place less emphasis on the form of honor than they do on its content. They are heathens, after all, who have no understanding of purity and pollution. But even heathens can have honor."</p>
<a id="p1027" name="p1027"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1027)">Damodara was silent for a moment, gazing away, thinking. Then:</p>
<a id="p1028" name="p1028"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1028)">"Still&#151;do you really think a great general would stoop so low, simply for the sake of spying? It's true, we have the secret of the Veda weapons. But I do not see where he has been able to learn much. We have been very careful. As you know&#151;it is your own charge."</p>
<a id="p1029" name="p1029"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1029)">"Nor have I failed that charge," replied Sanga. Then, grudgingly: "And it is true, he has not been in a position to learn much."</p>
<a id="p1030" name="p1030"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1030)">Damodara pressed on:</p>
<a id="p1031" name="p1031"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1031)">"Nor would he in the future, no matter how far he were to&#151;how did you put it?&#151;'insinuate himself into our graces.'&#160;"</p>
<a id="p1032" name="p1032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1032)">The Malwa lord, Sanga noted, was courteous enough not to add: any more than we have ever allowed Rajput generals to learn the secrets.&#160;</p>
<a id="p1033" name="p1033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1033)">Now it was Sanga's turn to hesitate, tug his beard.</p>
<a id="p1034" name="p1034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1034)">"I understand your words, Lord. I have given some thought to the matter, myself. I do not understand what Belisarius is doing, but I do know the man is incredibly shrewd. And that he sees opportunities where others do not."</p>
<a id="p1035" name="p1035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1035)">Damodara frowned. "I have not seen any&#151; Explain."</p>
<a id="p1036" name="p1036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1036)">Sanga smiled grimly. "Yes, you <i>have</i> seen, Lord Damodara. You simply did not notice&#151;as I did not myself, at the time."</p>
<a id="p1037" name="p1037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1037)">Sanga pointed down the slope upon which the pavilion rested. To that same battlefield which had seen Ranapur's final charge. "I am a good general," he stated.</p>
<a id="p1038" name="p1038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1038)">"You are a great general," countered Damodara.</p>
<a id="p1039" name="p1039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1039)">Sanga grimaced. "So I had thought, once. But let me ask you, Lord Damodara&#151;<i>why didn't I think to rally the soldiers on that battleground? </i>It would have been far easier for me, with five hundred Rajputs at my disposal, than for a foreigner with only three men.<i> </i>But I did not think of it, then. I took the direct course, the simple course. The obvious course."</p>
<a id="p1040" name="p1040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1040)">Damodara stared down at the battlefield. Even now, days later, the grisly signs of death were everywhere apparent.</p>
<a id="p1041" name="p1041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1041)">"I&#151;begin to understand your point. You are saying that he is a man who will, almost automatically, approach his task from the side. From an angle, so to speak."</p>
<a id="p1042" name="p1042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1042)">Sanga nodded. Then, made a small gesture toward the pavilion.</p>
<a id="p1043" name="p1043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1043)">"In there, Lord Damodara, I likened Belisarius to a tiger. And I suggested the use of a long stick."</p>
<a id="p1044" name="p1044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1044)">Damodara nodded, smiling.</p>
<a id="p1045" name="p1045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1045)">"It is a poor analogy, the more I think about it. A tiger, you can bait with a long stick. But ask yourself this, Lord Damodara: how long a stick must you use if you seek to bait a mongoose?"</p>
<a id="p1046" name="p1046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1046)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1047" name="p1047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1047)">Later, when the assembly reconvened, Lord Damodara demanded that only the innermost circle of Malwa advisers be allowed to remain. The Emperor agreed, readily enough, and the pavilion was cleared of all others. Even the Ye-tai bodyguards stood far back, well out of hearing range.</p>
<a id="p1048" name="p1048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1048)">When he rose to speak, Lord Damodara repeated nothing of his conversation with Rana Sanga. The Rajput sense of honor was foreign to him, but he understood it. It was that understanding, perhaps, which caused him to shield Sanga from retribution.</p>
<a id="p1049" name="p1049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1049)">Instead, he simply exercised&#151;for the first time ever&#151;his sacred right as a kinsman of the highest Malwa. He demanded that the problem of Belisarius be placed before the highest authority.</p>
<a id="p1050" name="p1050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1050)">The demand would have astonished anyone other than the men in that pavilion. All the world knew&#151;all of India, at least&#151;that Emperor Skandagupta was the very God-on-Earth. The highest of all authority.</p>
<a id="p1051" name="p1051"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1051)">But the men in that room knew otherwise. Great as Skandagupta was, another was greater still. Above the God-on-Earth, after all, are the heavens.</p>
<a id="p1052" name="p1052"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1052)">His demand was agreed to. Grudgingly, to be sure&#151;angrily, on the part of Venandakatra. But agreed to it was, for they had no choice.</p>
<a id="p1053" name="p1053"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1053)">The question of Belisarius would be taken to the very soul of the dynasty. To the great mind of Malwa's destiny. To the divine being called Link.</p>
<a id="p1054" name="p1054"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1054)"><i>Link.</i> A strange name, but appropriate. For, as the divine being had often explained, it was simply the face shown to humanity of the great, new, Gods-in-Heaven.</p>
<a id="p1055" name="p1055"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1055)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1056" name="p1056"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1056)">Later that night, long after all his other Rajputs were asleep, Rana Sanga stood in the entrance of his own tent. He had stood there for hours, almost motionless, simply staring. Staring at the moon, for a time. Staring, for a longer time, at the flickering fires which still burned, here and there, in the rubble which had once been called Ranapur. Staring, and lost in thought.</p>
<a id="p1057" name="p1057"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1057)">Ranapur was silent, now, so Sanga's thoughts were not interrupted by noise. True, the stench of Ranapur's death penetrated his nostrils. But the Rajput had long been familiar with that particular odor. His mind automatically blocked it out.</p>
<a id="p1058" name="p1058"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1058)">Finally, Sanga turned away. One last glance at the moon, high and silvery, before he entered his tent.</p>
<a id="p1059" name="p1059"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1059)">His last thought, before he stooped into the darkness, was the same thought which he had clung to throughout those long hours.</p>
<a id="p1060" name="p1060"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1060)"><i>I swore an oath.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p1061" name="p1061"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1061)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1062" name="p1062"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1062)">The next morning, imperial heralds spread throughout the gigantic encampment, carrying the announcement that the emperor was returning to Kausambi. The announcement came much sooner than anyone had expected, and so the preparations for departure were ragged and disorganized.</p>
<a id="p1063" name="p1063"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1063)">The foreigners in the encampment, from long and ingrained habit, made their preparations within an hour. Their obvious, simple, direct preparations, at least. Their other preparations took much longer, more than a day, but they had plenty of time. Plenty of time to see to the movement of many excellent, high-spirited horses and a few small, docile elephants. Plenty of time, even, to see to it that those movements had no apparent connection to them.</p>
<a id="p1064" name="p1064"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1064)">Plenty of time. Not for three days more did the first departure take place from the encampment. A small army&#151;a large army, actually, by any but Malwa standards&#151;began its long march southward. The army which had been assigned to Lord Venandakatra, in his new manifestation as the <i>Goptri of the Deccan</i>. It was a glorious manifestation, even by Venandakatra's standards, and so the great Lord was mollified for the unseemly haste with which he made his departure.</p>
<a id="p1065" name="p1065"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1065)">Of the various types of Malwa governorships, none was so prestigious as "Goptri." (The term, as closely as possible, could have been translated in the western lands as: <i>Warden of the Marches</i>.) No ordinary governor, Venandakatra, to be assigned to a small and placid province. Not even an ordinary satrap, Venandakatra, assigned to a large and placid region.
