<a id="p2840" name="p2840"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2840)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p2841" name="p2841"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2841)">The cell they gave me wasn't bad by Hagroon standards, but that didn't keep me from pounding on the bars and yelling. I had my slug gun, of course&#151;but since they wouldn't recognize it as a weapon even if I showed it, there was no chance of bluff. And I wasn't quite ready yet to kill. There were still several hours to go before the crisis and my call wouldn't take long&#151;once they saw reason.</p>
<a id="p2842" name="p2842"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2842)">The fat man had gone away, promising that an official from the military sub-station at Sodra would be along soon. Meantime I pounded and demanded that another call be put through&#151;but nobody listened. Now my chance to use the gun was gone. The man with the keys kept to the outer office.</p>
<a id="p2843" name="p2843"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2843)">A slack-looking youth in baggy pants and wide blue and yellow suspenders brought me in a small smorgasbord about noon. I tried to bribe him to make the call for me. He gave me a crooked smile and turned away.</p>
<a id="p2844" name="p2844"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2844)">It was well after dark when there was a sudden stir in the outer room of the jail. Then the metal door clanged open and a familiar face appeared&#151;a field agent I had met once or twice in the course of my duties with Intelligence. He was a tall, worried-looking man, wearing drab civvies and carrying a briefcase. He stopped dead when he saw me, then came on hesitantly.</p>
<a id="p2845" name="p2845"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2845)">"Hello, Captain," I greeted him. "We'll all have a good chuckle over this later, as the saying goes, but right now I need out of here fast . . ."</p>
<a id="p2846" name="p2846"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2846)">The cop who had arrested me was behind him, and the fat man from the post office.</p>
<a id="p2847" name="p2847"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2847)">"You know my name?" the agent asked awkwardly.</p>
<a id="p2848" name="p2848"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2848)">"I'm afraid not&#151;but I think you know me. We've met once or twice&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2849" name="p2849"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2849)">"Listen to the fellow," the fat man said. "A violent case&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2850" name="p2850"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2850)">"Silence!" the agent snapped. He came up close, looked me over carefully.</p>
<a id="p2851" name="p2851"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2851)">"You wished to place a call to Intelligence HQ," he said. "What did you wish to speak about?"</p>
<a id="p2852" name="p2852"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2852)">"I'll tell them myself," I snapped. "Get me out of here, Captain&#151;in a hell of a hurry! This is top priority business!"</p>
<a id="p2853" name="p2853"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2853)">"You may tell me what it is you wished to report," he said.</p>
<a id="p2854" name="p2854"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2854)">"I'll report directly to Baron Richthofen!"</p>
<a id="p2855" name="p2855"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2855)">He lifted his shoulders. "You place me in an awkward position&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2856" name="p2856"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2856)">"To hell with your position! Can't you understand plain Swedish? I'm telling you&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2857" name="p2857"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2857)">"You will address an officer of Imperial Intelligence with more respect!" the cop broke in.</p>
<a id="p2858" name="p2858"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2858)">The agent turned to the two men behind him. "Clear out, both of you!" he snapped. They left, looking crestfallen. He turned back to me, wiped a hand across his forehead.</p>
<a id="p2859" name="p2859"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2859)">"This is very difficult for me," he said. "You bear a close resemblance to Colonel Bayard&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2860" name="p2860"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2860)">"Resemblance! Hell, I <i>am</i> Bayard!"</p>
<a id="p2861" name="p2861"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2861)">He shook his head. "I was assured on that point, most specifically," he said. "I don't know what this is all about, my friend, but it will be better for you to tell me the whole story&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2862" name="p2862"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2862)">"The story is that I have information of vital importance to the Imperium! Every minute counts, man! Forget the red tape! Get me a line to Headquarters!"</p>
<a id="p2863" name="p2863"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2863)">"You are an imposter. We know that much. You asked to have a call placed. A routine check at Colonel Bayard's home indicated that he was there&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2864" name="p2864"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2864)">"I can't try to explain all the paradoxes involved. Just put my call through!"</p>
<a id="p2865" name="p2865"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2865)">"It is not possible to route every crank call to the Chief of Intelligence!" the man snapped. "What is this message of yours? If it seems to warrant attention, I will personally&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2866" name="p2866"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2866)">"Let me talk to Bayard, then," I cut in.</p>
<a id="p2867" name="p2867"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2867)">"Ah, then you abandon your imposture?"</p>
<a id="p2868" name="p2868"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2868)">"Call it what you like. Let me talk to him!"</p>
<a id="p2869" name="p2869"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2869)">"That is not possible&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2870" name="p2870"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2870)">"I didn't know we had anyone in the service as stupid as you are," I said clearly. "All right, I'll give you the message&#151;and by all you hold sacred, you'd better believe me."</p>
<a id="p2871" name="p2871"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2871)">He didn't. He was polite, and heard me all the way through. Then he signaled for the jailer and got ready to leave.</p>
<a id="p2872" name="p2872"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2872)">"You can't walk out of here without at least checking my story!" I roared at him. "What kind of intelligence man are you? Take a look at the suit I had with me, damn you! That will show you I'm not imagining the whole thing!"</p>
<a id="p2873" name="p2873"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2873)">He looked at me, a troubled look. "How can I believe you? Your claim to be Bayard is a lie, and the story you tell is fantastic! Would <i>you</i> have believed it?"</p>
<a id="p2874" name="p2874"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2874)">I stared back at him.</p>
<a id="p2875" name="p2875"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2875)">"I don't know," I said, honestly. "But I'd at least have checked what I could."</p>
<a id="p2876" name="p2876"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2876)">He turned to the cop, who was back, hovering at the door.</p>
<a id="p2877" name="p2877"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2877)">"You have this . . . shuttle suit?"</p>
<a id="p2878" name="p2878"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2878)">The cop nodded. "Yes, sir. I have it here on my desk. I've checked it for . . ." his voice faded as he and the agent went out and the door shut behind them. For another half hour I paced the cell, wondering whether I should have shot a couple of them and tried to scare the cop into unlocking me; but from what I knew of the men of the Imperium, it wouldn't have worked. They were too damned brave for their own good.</p>
<a id="p2879" name="p2879"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2879)">Then the door clanged open again. A stranger was there this time&#151;a small man with a runny nose and eyes, and glasses as thick as checkers.</p>
<a id="p2880" name="p2880"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2880)">" . . . very odd, very odd," he was saying. "But meaningless, of course. The circuitry is quite inert . . ."</p>
<a id="p2881" name="p2881"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2881)">"This is Herr Professor Doctor Runngvist," the agent said. "He's checked your . . . ah . . . suit, and assures me that it's crank work. A homemade hoax of some sort, incapable of any&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2882" name="p2882"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2882)">"Damn you!" I yelled. "Sure the suit's inert&#151;without me in it! I'm part of the circuitry! It's attuned to me!"</p>
<a id="p2883" name="p2883"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2883)">"Eh? Tuned to you? A part of the circuitry?" The old man adjusted his glasses at an angle to get a better view of me.</p>
<a id="p2884" name="p2884"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2884)">"Look, pops, this is a highly sophisticated device. It utilizes the wearer's somatic and neural fields as a part of the total circuitry. Without me inside, it won't work. Let me have it. I'll demonstrate it for you&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2885" name="p2885"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2885)">"Sorry, I can't allow that," the agent said quickly. "Look here, fellow, hadn't you better drop this show now, and tell me what it's all about? You're in pretty deep water already, I'd say, impersonating an officer&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2886" name="p2886"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2886)">"You know Bayard on sight, don't you?" I cut in.</p>
<a id="p2887" name="p2887"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2887)">"Yes . . ."</p>
<a id="p2888" name="p2888"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2888)">"Do I look like him?"</p>
<a id="p2889" name="p2889"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2889)">He looked worried. "Yes, to an extent. I presume it was that which inspired this imposture, but&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2890" name="p2890"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2890)">"Listen to me, Captain," I said as levelly as I could through the bars. "This is the biggest crisis the Imperium has faced since Chief Inspector Bale ran amok . . ."</p>
<a id="p2891" name="p2891"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2891)">The captain frowned. "How did you know of that?"</p>
<a id="p2892" name="p2892"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2892)">"I was there. My name's Bayard, remember? Now get me out of here&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2893" name="p2893"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2893)">There was a shrilling of a telephone bell in the outer room. Feet clumped. Voices rumbled. Then the door flew open.</p>
<a id="p2894" name="p2894"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2894)">"Inspector! It's a call&#151;from Stockholm . . ."</p>
<a id="p2895" name="p2895"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2895)">My inquisitors turned. "Yes?"</p>
<a id="p2896" name="p2896"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2896)">"That fellow&#151;Colonel Bayard!" an excited voice said. Someone shushed him. They stood in the hall, conversing in whispers. Then the intelligence captain came back with the cop behind him.</p>
<a id="p2897" name="p2897"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2897)">"You'd better start telling all you know," he snapped, looking grimmer than ever.</p>
<a id="p2898" name="p2898"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2898)">"What happened?"</p>
<a id="p2899" name="p2899"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2899)">"Stockholm is under attack by an armed force of undetermined size!"</p>
<a id="p2900" name="p2900"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2900)">It was close to midnight now. I had been looking for a chance for a break for the past hour, but Captain Burman, the agent, was taking no chances. He had locked the outer door to the cell block and nobody was allowed even to come close to my cell. I think he was beginning to suspect that everything wasn't as simple as it appeared.</p>
<a id="p2901" name="p2901"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2901)">I watched the door across the aisle as a key clattered in it and it swung wide. It was Burman, white-faced, and two strangers, both in civilian clothes. My wrist tensed, ready to flip the gun into my palm, but they kept their distance.</p>
<a id="p2902" name="p2902"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2902)">"This is the man." Burman waved at me like a tenant complaining about a prowler. "I've gotten nothing from him but nonsense&#151;or what I thought was nonsense, until now!"</p>
<a id="p2903" name="p2903"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2903)">The newcomers looked me over. One was a short, thick-set, hairless man in wide lapels and baggy-kneed pants. The other was trim, neat, well set up. I decided to make my pitch to the former. No underling could afford to look that messy.</p>
<a id="p2904" name="p2904"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2904)">"Listen, you," I started. "I'm Colonel Bayard, of Imperial Intelligence&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2905" name="p2905"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2905)">"I will listen, of that you may be assured," the little man said. "Start at the beginning and repeat what you have told the Captain."</p>
<a id="p2906" name="p2906"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2906)">"It's too late for talk." I flipped the gun into my hand. All three of them jumped, and a heavy automatic appeared in the snappy dresser's hand.</p>
<a id="p2907" name="p2907"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2907)">"Ever seen one of these before?" I showed the slug gun, keeping the armed man covered.</p>
<a id="p2908" name="p2908"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2908)">The thick man jerked his head in a quick nod.</p>
<a id="p2909" name="p2909"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2909)">"Then you know they're only issued to a few people in Net Surveillance work&#151;including me. I could have shot my way out of here when I first arrived, but I thought I'd get a fair hearing without killing anybody. Now it's too late for humanitarianism. One of you open up, or I start shooting&#151;and I'm faster than you are, Buster," I added for the benefit of the tall man with the gun.</p>
<a id="p2910" name="p2910"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2910)">"Here, you're only making it worse&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2911" name="p2911"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2911)">"It couldn't be worse. Get the key. Call that dumb flatfoot out front."</p>
<a id="p2912" name="p2912"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2912)">The thick man shook his head. "Shoot then, sir. Major Gunnarson will then be forced to return your fire, and so two men will die. But I will not release you."</p>
<a id="p2913" name="p2913"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2913)">"Why not? You can watch me. All I want to do is call Intelligence&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2914" name="p2914"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2914)">"I do not know what set of signals you may have worked out, or with whom, and I do not intend to find out at the expense of Imperial security."</p>
<a id="p2915" name="p2915"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2915)">"There's not any Imperial security, as long as you keep me here. I've told my story to Burman! Take action! Do something!"</p>
<a id="p2916" name="p2916"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2916)">"I have already attempted to relay your statement to Baron Richthofen at Stockholm," the rumpled man said.</p>
<a id="p2917" name="p2917"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2917)">"What do you mean, attempted?"</p>
<a id="p2918" name="p2918"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2918)">"Just that. I was unable to get through. All telephonic connection is broken, I found. I sent a messenger. He failed to return. Another messenger has reached me but now. He was dispatched an hour ago, and heard the news over his auto radio set just before . . ."</p>
<a id="p2919" name="p2919"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2919)">"Just before what?"</p>
<a id="p2920" name="p2920"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2920)">"Before the gas attack," he said in a harsh voice. Abruptly there was a gun in his hand&#151;a heavy revolver. He had drawn it so quickly that I couldn't even say where he'd gotten it.</p>
<a id="p2921" name="p2921"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2921)">"Now, tell me all you know of these matters, Mr. Bayard, or whatever your name might be! You have ten seconds to begin!"</p>
<a id="p2922" name="p2922"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2922)">I kept my gun on his partner. I knew that if I moved it as much as a millimeter, the baggy man would gun me down. I tried to match the steely look in his eye.</p>
<a id="p2923" name="p2923"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2923)">"I told Burman the whole story. If you choose not to believe it, that's not my fault. But there may still be time. What's the situation in the city?"</p>
<a id="p2924" name="p2924"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2924)">"There is <i>no</i> time, Mr. Bayard. No time at all . . ." To my horror I saw a tear glisten at the corner of the thick man's eye.</p>
<a id="p2925" name="p2925"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2925)">"What . . ." I couldn't finish the question.</p>
<a id="p2926" name="p2926"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2926)">"The invaders have released a poisonous gas which has blanketed the city. They have erected barricades against any attempt at relief. Strange men in helmeted suits are shooting down every man who approaches . . ."</p>
<a id="p2927" name="p2927"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2927)">"But what about . . . the people . . . What about my wife? What&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2928" name="p2928"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2928)">He was shaking his head. "The Emperor and his family, the government, everyone, all must be presumed dead, Mr. Bayard, inside the barricaded city!"</p>
<a id="p2929" name="p2929"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2929)">There was a shattering crash from the outer room. The thick man whirled from me, jumped to the door, shot a look out, then went through at a dead run, Burman at his heels. I yelled at Major Gunnarson to stop or I'd shoot, but he didn't and neither did I. There was a clatter of feet, a crash like breaking glass, a couple of shots. Someone yelled "The ape-men!" There were more shots, then a heavy slam like a body hitting the floor. I backed into the corner of my cell, cursing the fatal mistake I'd made in letting myself get cornered here. I aimed at the door, waited for the first Hagroon to come through&#151;</p>
<a id="p2930" name="p2930"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2930)">The door flew open&#151;and a familiar narrow-shouldered figure in stained whites sauntered into view.</p>
<a id="p2931" name="p2931"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2931)">"Dzok!" I yelled. "Get me out of here&#151;or&#151;" A horrible suspicion dawned. Dzok must have seen it in my face.</p>
<a id="p2932" name="p2932"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2932)">"Easy, old fellow!" he shouted as my gun covered him. "I'm here to give you a spot of assistance, old chap&#151;and from the looks of things, you can jolly well use it!"</p>
<a id="p2933" name="p2933"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2933)">"What's going on out there?" I yelled. There was someone behind Dzok. A tall young fellow in a green coat and scarlet knee pants came through the door, holding a long-barreled rifle with a short bayonet fixed to the end of it. There were white facings on the coat, wide loops of braid, and rows of bright gold buttons. There was a wide cocked hat on his head, with a gold fringe and a crimson rosette, and he wore white stockings and polished black shoes with large gilt buckles. The owner of the finery flashed me a big smile, then turned to Dzok and gave a sloppy salute with the palm of his hand out.</p>
<a id="p2934" name="p2934"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2934)">"I reckon we peppered 'em good, sor. Now what say ye we have a look about out back here for any more o' the gossoons as might be skulkin' ready to do in a honest man?"</p>
<a id="p2935" name="p2935"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2935)">"Never mind that, sergeant," Dzok said. "This is a jail delivery, nothing more. Those chaps out there are our allies, actually. Pity about the shooting, but it couldn't be helped." He was talking to me now. "I attempted to make a few inquiries, but found everyone in a state of the most extreme agitation. They opened fire with hardly a second glance, amid shouts of 'hairy ape-men'! Disgraceful&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2936" name="p2936"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2936)">"The Hagroon have hit the capital," I cut him off. "Laid down a gas attack, barricaded the streets, everybody presumed dead . . ." I wasn't thinking now&#151;just reacting. The Hagroon had to be stopped. That was all that mattered. Not that anything really mattered any more, with Barbro gone with the rest&#151;but she was a fighter. She'd have expected me to go on fighting, too, as long as I could still move and breathe.</p>
<a id="p2937" name="p2937"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2937)">Dzok looked stricken. "Beastly, old fellow! I can't tell you how sorry I am . . ." He commiserated with me for awhile. Then the sergeant came back from the outer room with a key, opened my cell door.</p>
<a id="p2938" name="p2938"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2938)">"And so I came too late," Dzok said bitterly. "I had hoped . . ." He let the sentence trail off, as we went into the outer room.</p>
<a id="p2939" name="p2939"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2939)">"Who are these fellows?" I gaped at the half-dozen bright-plumaged soldiers posted about the jail covering the windows and the door.</p>
<a id="p2940" name="p2940"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2940)">"These are my volunteers, Bayard&#151;my Napoleonic levies. I was on a recruiting mission, you'll recall. After I left you, I went back and loaded these chaps into my cargo shuttle, and returned to Zaj&#151;and found&#151;you'll never guess, old fellow!"</p>
<a id="p2941" name="p2941"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2941)">"I'll take three guesses," I said, "and they'll all be 'the Hagroon.'"</p>
<a id="p2942" name="p2942"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2942)">Dzok nodded glumly. "The bounders had overrun Authority headquarters, including the Web terminal, of course. I beat a hasty strategic retreat, and followed your trail here . . ." he paused, looking embarrassed. "Actually, old chap, I'd hoped to enlist the aid of your Imperium. We Xonijeelians are ill-equipped to fight a Web war, I'm sorry to say. Always before&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2943" name="p2943"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2943)">"I know. They caught us off-guard too. I wondered all along why you figured you were immune&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2944" name="p2944"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2944)">"The audacity of the blighters! Who'd have expected&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2945" name="p2945"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2945)">"You should have," I said shortly.</p>
<a id="p2946" name="p2946"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2946)">"Ah, well, what's done is done." Dzok rubbed his hands together with every appearance of relish. "Inasmuch as you're not in a position to assist me, perhaps my chaps and I can still be of some help here. Better start by giving me a complete resum&eacute; of the situation . . ."</p>
<a id="p2947" name="p2947"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2947)">After ten minutes' talk, while the troops kept up a sporadic fire from the jail windows, Dzok and I had decided on a plan of action. It wasn't a good one, but under the circumstances it was better than nothing. The first step was to find the S-suit. We wasted another ten minutes searching the place before I decided to try the vault. It was open, and the suit was laid out on a table.</p>
<a id="p2948" name="p2948"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2948)">"Right," Dzok said with satisfaction. "I'll need tools, Bayard, and a heat source and a magnifying glass . . ."</p>
<a id="p2949" name="p2949"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2949)">We rummaged, found a complete tool kit in a wall locker and a glass in the chief's desk drawer. I made a hasty adaptation of a hot plate used for heating coffee, while Dzok opened up the control console set in the chest of the suit.</p>
<a id="p2950" name="p2950"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2950)">"We're treading on dangerous ground, of course," he said blandly, while he snipped hair-fire wires, teased them into new arrangements. "What I'm attempting is theoretically possible, but it's never been tried&#151;not with an S-suit."</p>
<a id="p2951" name="p2951"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2951)">I watched admiring the dexterity of his long grayish fingers as he rearranged the internal components of the incredibly compact installation. For half an hour, while guns cracked intermittently, he made tests, muttered, tried again, studying the readings on the miniature scales set on the cuff of the suit. Then he straightened, gave me a wry look.</p>
<a id="p2952" name="p2952"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2952)">"It's done, old chap. I can't guarantee the results of my makeshift mods, but there's at least an even chance that it will do what we want."</p>
<a id="p2953" name="p2953"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2953)">I asked for an explanation of what he had done, followed closely as he pointed out the interplay of circuits that placed stresses on the M-C field in such a way as to distort its normal function along a line of geometric progression leading to infinity . . . </p>
<a id="p2954" name="p2954"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2954)">"It's over my head, Dzok," I told him. "I was never a really first-class M-C man, and when it comes to your Xonijeelian complexities&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2955" name="p2955"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2955)">"Don't trouble your head, Bayard. All you need to know is that adjusting this setting . . ." he pointed with a pin drill at a tiny knurled knob&#151;"controls the angle of incidence of the pinch-field&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2956" name="p2956"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2956)">"In plain English, if something goes wrong and I'm not dead, I can twiddle that and try again."</p>
<a id="p2957" name="p2957"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2957)">"Very succinctly put. Not let's be going. How far did you say it is to the city?"</p>
<a id="p2958" name="p2958"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2958)">"About twelve kilometers."</p>
<a id="p2959" name="p2959"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2959)">"Right. We'll have to commandeer a pair of light lorries. There are several parked in the court just outside. Some sort of crude steam-cars, I think&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2960" name="p2960"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2960)">"Internal combustion. And not so crude; they'll do a hundred kilometers an hour."</p>
<a id="p2961" name="p2961"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2961)">"They'll serve." He went into the guard room, checked the scene from the windows.</p>
<a id="p2962" name="p2962"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2962)">"Quiet out there at the moment. No point in waiting about. Let's sally at once." I nodded and Dzok gave his orders to the gaily costumed riflemen, five of whom quietly took up positions at the windows and door facing the courtyard, while the others formed up a cordon around Dzok and me.</p>
<a id="p2963" name="p2963"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2963)">"Hell, we may as well do our bit," I suggested. There were carbines in the gun locker. I took one, tossed one to Dzok, buckled on a belt and stuffed it with ammo.</p>
<a id="p2964" name="p2964"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2964)">"Tell your lads to shoot low," I said. "Don't let anybody get in our way, but try not to kill anybody. They don't know what's going on out there&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2965" name="p2965"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2965)">"And there's no time to explain," Dzok finished for me, looking at his men. "Shoot to wound, right, lads? Now, Sergeant, take three men and move out. Cover the first lorry and hold your fire until they start something. Mr. Bayard and I will come next, with ten men, while the rest of you lay down a covering fire. Those in the rear guard stand fast until number two lorry pulls up to the door, then pile in quickly and we're off."</p>
<a id="p2966" name="p2966"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2966)">"Very well, sor," the sergeant said. He was working hard on a plug of tobacco he'd found in the police chief's desk drawer. He turned and bawled instructions to his men, who nodded, grinning.</p>
<a id="p2967" name="p2967"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2967)">"These boys don't behave like recruits," I said. "They look like veterans to me."</p>
<a id="p2968" name="p2968"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2968)">Dzok nodded, smiling his incredible smile. "Former members of the Welsh regiment of the Imperial Guard. They were eager for a change."</p>
<a id="p2969" name="p2969"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2969)">"I wonder what you offered them?"</p>
<a id="p2970" name="p2970"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2970)">"The suggestion of action after a few months changing of the guard at Westminster was sufficient."</p>
<a id="p2971" name="p2971"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2971)">The sergeant was at the door now, with two of his men. He said a quick word, and the three darted out, sprinted for the lorry, a high-sided dark blue panel truck lettered flottsbro polis. A scattering of shots rang out. Grass tips flew as bullets clipped the turf by the sergeant's ankle. The man on his left stumbled, went down, rolled, came up limping, his thigh wet with a dark glisten against the scarlet cloth. He made it in two jumps to the shelter of the truck, hit the grass, leveled his musket and fired. A moment later, all three were in position, their guns crackling in a one-round-per-second rhythm. The opposing fire slackened.</p>
<a id="p2972" name="p2972"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2972)">"Now," Dzok said. I brought the carbine up across my chest and dashed for the second truck. There was a white puff of smoke from a window overlooking the courtyard, a whine past my head. I ducked, pounded across the grass, leaped the chain at the edge of the pavement, skidded to a halt beside the lorry. Dzok was there ahead of me, wrenching at the door.</p>
<a id="p2973" name="p2973"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2973)">"Locked!" he called, and stepped back, fired a round into the keyhole, wrenched the door open. I caught a glimpse of his shuttle, a heavy passenger-carrying job, parked across a flowerbed. He followed my gaze.</p>
<a id="p2974" name="p2974"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2974)">"Just have to leave it. Too bad . . ." He was inside then, staring at the unfamiliar controls.</p>
<a id="p2975" name="p2975"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2975)">"Slide over!" I pushed in beside him, feeling the vehicle lurch as the men crowded in behind me, hearing the <i>sprang!</i> as a shot hit the metal body. There were no keys in the ignition. I tried the starter; nothing.</p>
<a id="p2976" name="p2976"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2976)">"I'll have to short the wiring," I said, and slid to the ground, jumped to the hood, unlatched the wide side panel, lifted it. With one hard jerk, I twisted the ignition wires free, made hasty connections to the battery, then grabbed the starter lever and depressed it. The engine groaned, turned over twice, and caught with a roar. I slammed the hood down as a bullet cut a bright streak in it, jumped for the seat.</p>
<a id="p2977" name="p2977"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2977)">"Who's driving the second truck?"</p>
<a id="p2978" name="p2978"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2978)">"I have a chap who's a steam-car operator&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2979" name="p2979"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2979)">"No good. I'll have to start it for him . . ." I was out again, running for the other lorry, parked twenty feet away. A worried-looking man with damp red hair plastered to a freckled forehead was fumbling with the dash lighter and headlight switch. There was a key in the switch of this one; I twisted it, jammed a foot against the starter. The engine caught, ran smoothly.</p>
<a id="p2980" name="p2980"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2980)">"You know how to shift gears?"</p>
<a id="p2981" name="p2981"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2981)">He nodded, smiling.</p>
<a id="p2982" name="p2982"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2982)">"This is the gas pedal. Push on it and you go faster. This is the brake . . ." He nodded eagerly. "If you stall out, push this floor button. The rest is just steering."</p>
<a id="p2983" name="p2983"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2983)">He nodded again as glass smashed in front of him, throwing splinters in our faces. Blood ran from a cut across his cheek, but he brushed the chips away, gave me a wave. I ran for it, reached my truck, slammed it in gear, watched a moment to see that the redhead picked up the rear guard. Then I gunned for the closed iron gates, hit them with a crash at twenty miles an hour, slammed through, twisted the wheel hard left, and thundered away down the narrow street.</p>
<a id="p2984" name="p2984"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2984)">It took us twenty minutes to cover the twelve kilometers to the edge of the city. For the last hundred yards, we slowed, steered a course among bodies lying in the street, pulled up at a rough barricade of automobiles turned on their sides and blackened by fire, bright tongues of flame still licking over the smouldering tires. A church tower clock was tolling midnight&#151;a merry sound to accompany the cheery picture.</p>
<a id="p2985" name="p2985"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2985)">I looked at the dark towers of the city behind the barrier, the dark streets. There were at least a dozen men in sight, sprawled in the unlovely attitudes of violent death. None was in uniform or armed; they were bystanders, caught in the clouds of poison that had rolled out from the city's streets. There were no Hagroon in sight. The streets were as still as a graveyard.</p>
<a id="p2986" name="p2986"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2986)">There was a sound to the left. I brought my carbine up, saw a hatless man in a white shirt.</p>
<a id="p2987" name="p2987"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2987)">"Thank God you've got here at last," he choked. "I got a whiff&#151;sick as a dog. Pulled a couple back, but . . ." he coughed, retched, bending double. "Too late. All dead. Gas is gone now, blown away . . ."</p>
<a id="p2988" name="p2988"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2988)">"Get farther back," I said. "Spread the word not to try to attack the barricades." There was another man behind him, and a woman, her fact soot-streaked.</p>
<a id="p2989" name="p2989"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2989)">"What do you want us to do?" someone called. They clustered around the car, a dozen battered survivors, thinking we were the police, and ready to do whatever had to be done to help us.</p>
<a id="p2990" name="p2990"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2990)">"Just stay back, keep out of harm's way. We're going to try something&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2991" name="p2991"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2991)">Someone yelled then, pointing at Dzok. A cry went through the crowd.</p>
<a id="p2992" name="p2992"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2992)">"Everybody out&#151;fast!" I barked to the men in the rear of the truck. Then: "This is a friend!" I yelled to the crowd. I jumped down, ran around to the side where the man had raised his first outcry, caught him by the arm as he jerked at the shattered door handle.</p>
<a id="p2993" name="p2993"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2993)">"Listen to me! This isn't the enemy! He's an ally of the Imperium! He's here to help! These are his troops!" I waved at the ten costumed soldiers who had formed a rough circle around the truck. The headlights of the second truck swung into view then. It growled up beside the first, chugged to a stop and stalled out. The doors flew open and men swarmed out.</p>
<a id="p2994" name="p2994"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2994)">"He's got hair on his face&#151;just like the others&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2995" name="p2995"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2995)">"You saw them?"</p>
<a id="p2996" name="p2996"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2996)">"No&#151;but I heard&#151;from the man I pulled back from the barricade&#151;before he died&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2997" name="p2997"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2997)">"Well, I don't have hair on my face&#151;unless you want to count three days' beard. This is Commander Dzok! He's on our side. Now, spread the word! I don't want any accidents!"</p>
<a id="p2998" name="p2998"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2998)">"Who're you?"</p>
<a id="p2999" name="p2999"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2999)">"I'm Colonel Bayard, Imperial Intelligence. I'm here to do what I can&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3000" name="p3000"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3000)">"What can we do?" several voices called. I repeated my instructions to stay back.</p>
<a id="p3001" name="p3001"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3001)">"What about you?" the man who had spotted Dzok asked me. "What's your plan, Colonel?"</p>
<a id="p3002" name="p3002"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3002)">Dzok was out of the car now. He handed the modified S-suit to me, turned and bowed in courtly fashion to the crowd.</p>
<a id="p3003" name="p3003"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3003)">"Enchanted, sirs and madams, to make your acquaintance," he called. Someone tittered, but Dzok ignored it. "I have the honor, as Colonel Bayard has said, to offer my services in the fight against the rude invader. But it is the Colonel himself who must carry out our mission here tonight. The rest of us can merely assist . . ."</p>
<a id="p3004" name="p3004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3004)">"What's he going to do?"</p>
<a id="p3005" name="p3005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3005)">I had the suit halfway on now. Dzok was helping me, pulling it up, getting my arms into the sleeves, settling the heavy chest pack in place, zipping long zippers closed.</p>
<a id="p3006" name="p3006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3006)">"Using this special equipment," Dzok said in his best theatrical manner, "Colonel Bayard will carry out a mission of the utmost peril . . ."</p>
<a id="p3007" name="p3007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3007)">"Skip the pitch and hand me the helmet," I interrupted him.</p>
<a id="p3008" name="p3008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3008)">"We want to help," someone called.</p>
<a id="p3009" name="p3009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3009)">"I'd like to go along," another voice said.</p>
<a id="p3010" name="p3010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3010)">"Our chief need at the moment," Dzok's voice rang above the rest, "is a supply of coffee. My brave lads are a trifle fatigued, not having rested since leaving their home barracks. For the rest, we can only wait&#151;"</p>
<a id="p3011" name="p3011"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3011)">"Why can't some of us go along, Colonel," a man said, stepping close. "You could use an escort&#151;and not those overdressed fancy dans, either!"</p>
<a id="p3012" name="p3012"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3012)">"The Colonel must go alone," Dzok said. "Alone he will carry out a spy mission among the enemy&#151;on the other side of time!" He turned to me, and in a lower voice said: "Don't waste any time, old fellow. It's after midnight now&#151;in about two hours the world ends . . ."</p>
<a id="p3013" name="p3013"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3013)">The transparent helmet was in place, all the contacts tight. Dzok made a couple of quick checks, made me the O sign with his fingers that meant all systems were go. I put my hand on the "activate" button and took my usual deep breath. If Dzok's practice was as good as his theory, the rewired S-suit would twist the fabric of reality in a different manner than its designers had intended, stress the E-field of the normal continuum in a way that would expel me, like a watermelon seed squeezed in the fingers, into that curious non-temporal state of null entropy&#151;the other side of time, as he poetically called it.</p>
<a id="p3014" name="p3014"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3014)">If it worked, that was. And there was only one way to find out. I pressed the button&#151;</p>
<a id="p3015" name="p3015"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(3015)">&#160;</p>
