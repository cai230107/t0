<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Fifty-Six:<br>
TIME FADING</h2>

<p>Dawn comes early when you wish it would not. The hours flash
when you want them to drag. The following day was another of
executions. The only thing unusual was that the Limper came out to
watch. He seemed satisfied we were doing things right. He returned
to my quarters&mdash;where he sacked out in my bed.</p>

<p>My evening check on Raven showed little change. Case reported
that he had come near wakening several times and was mumbling in
his sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep pouring soup down him. And don&rsquo;t be afraid to
yell if you need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not sleep. I tried roaming the barracks, but near
silence reigned. A few sleepless Guards haunted the mess hall. They
fell silent at my arrival. I thought about going over to Blue
Willy. But I would find no better reception there. I was on
everybody&rsquo;s list.</p>

<p>It could do nothing but get worse.</p>

<p>I knew what the Lady meant about lonely.</p>

<p>I wished I had the nerve to visit her now that I needed a
hug.</p>

<p>I returned to my bedroll.</p>

<p>I did fall asleep this time; they had to threaten mayhem to get
me up.</p>

<p>We polished off the last of the Dominator&rsquo;s pets before
noon. The Lady ordered a holiday for the remainder of the day. Come
next morning we were to rehearse for the big show. She guessed we
had about forty-eight hours before the river opened the tomb. Time
to rest, time to practice, and ample time to get in the first
whack.</p>

<p>That afternoon Limper went out and flew around a while. He was
in high spirits. I seized the opportunity to visit my quarters and
poke around, but all I could find were a few black wood shavings
and a hint of silver dust, and barely enough of either to leave
traces. He had cleaned up hastily. I did not touch. No telling what
curiosities might occur if I did. Otherwise, I learned nothing.</p>

<p>The practice for the Event was tense. Everyone turned out,
including Limper and Bomanz, who had kept so low most everyone had
forgotten him. The wind whales ranged above the river. Their mantas
soared and swooped. Darling charged the Great Barrow down a
prepared aisle, stopping just short of far enough. The Taken and
Guards stood to their respective weapons.</p>

<p>It looked good. Looked like it would work. So why was I
convinced we were in for big trouble?</p>

<p>The moment our carpet touched down Case was beside it. &ldquo;I
need your help,&rdquo; he told me, ignoring the Lady. &ldquo;He
won&rsquo;t listen to me. He keeps trying to get up. He fell on his
face already twice.&rdquo; I glanced at the Lady. She gave me a
go-ahead nod. Raven was seated on the edge of his bed when I
arrived. &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re being a pain in the ass.
What&rsquo;s the point of pulling your butt out of the Barrowland
if you&rsquo;re going to commit suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His gaze rose slowly. He did not appear to recognize me. Oh,
damn, I thought. His mind is gone. &ldquo;He talked any,
Case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some. He don&rsquo;t always make sense. He don&rsquo;t
realize how long it&rsquo;s been, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we should restrain him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, we looked at Raven. He knew me now. &ldquo;No
restraints, Croaker. I&rsquo;ll behave.&rdquo; He flopped onto his
back, smiling. &ldquo;How long, Case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him the story,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to go whip up some medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just wanted away from Raven. He looked worse with his soul
restored. Cadaverous. Too much a reminder of my mortality. And that
was one thing I did not need on my mind more than it was.</p>

<p>I whipped up a couple potions. One would settle Raven&rsquo;s
shakes. The other would knock him out if he gave Case too much
trouble.</p>

<p>Raven gave me a dark look when I returned. I do not know how far
Case had gotten. &ldquo;Stay off your high horse,&rdquo; I told
him. &ldquo;You got no idea what&rsquo;s happened since Juniper. In
fact, not a whole lot since the Battle at Charm. You being the
brave and rugged loner hasn&rsquo;t helped. Drink this. It&rsquo;s
for the shakes.&rdquo; I gave Case the other mixture with whispered
instructions.</p>

<p>In a voice little above a whisper, Raven asked, &ldquo;Is it
true? Darling and the Lady are going after the Dominator tomorrow?
Together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do-or-die time. For everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay put. You, too, Case. We don&rsquo;t
want Darling distracted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had managed to abolish worries about the tangled ramifications
inherent in tomorrow&rsquo;s confrontations. Now they rushed in on
me again. The Dominator would not be the end of it. Unless we lost.
If he fell, the war with the Lady would resume instantly.</p>

<p>I wanted to see Darling badly, wanted in on her plans. I dared
not go. The Lady was keeping me on the leash. She might interrogate
me any time.</p>

<p>Lonely work. Lonely work.</p>

<p>Case went on tale-telling. Then Goblin and One-Eye dropped in to
tell stories from their perspectives. The Lady even looked in. She
beckoned me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I followed her to her quarters.</p>

<p>Outside, night had fallen. In about eighteen hours the Great
Barrow would open of its own accord. Sooner if we followed plan.
&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting fixated on it.
Butterflies the size of horses. Can&rsquo;t think about anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. I considered you as a distraction, but I cared
too much.&rdquo; Well, that distracted me. &ldquo;Perhaps one of
your potions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;There is no specific
for fear in my arsenal. I&rsquo;ve heard of
wizards&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those antidotes cost too dearly. We&rsquo;ll need our
wits about us. It won&rsquo;t go like it did in
rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow. She did not expand. I suppose she expected
a lot of improvisational behavior from her allies.</p>

<p>The mess sergeant appeared. His crew rolled in a grand meal they
set out on a table brought in special. A last feast for the
condemned? After the crowd dispersed, the Lady said, &ldquo;I
ordered the best for everyone. Your friends in town included.
Breakfast likewise.&rdquo; She seemed calm enough. But she was more
accustomed to high-risk
confrontations&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I snorted at myself. I recalled being asked for a hug. She was
as scared as anybody.</p>

<p>She saw but did not ask&mdash;tip enough that she was focused
inward.</p>

<p>The meal was a miracle considering what the cooks had to work
with. But it was nothing grand. We exchanged no words during its
course. I finished first, rested my elbows on the table, retreated
into thought. She followed suit. She had eaten very little. After a
few minutes she went to her bedroom. She returned with three black
arrows. Each had silver inlays in KurreTelle script. I had seen
their like before. Soulcatcher gave Raven one the time we ambushed
Limper and Whisper. She said, &ldquo;Use the bow I gave you. And
stay close.&rdquo; The arrows appeared identical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband. They can&rsquo;t kill him.
They lack his true name. But they&rsquo;ll slow him
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the rest of the plan will
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything is possible. But all eventualities
should be considered.&rdquo; Her eyes met mine. There was something
there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We looked away. She said,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go. Sleep well. I want you alert
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been arranged. For all but the duty
section.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Sorcery. One of the Taken would put everyone
to sleep. I rose. I dithered for a few seconds, putting logs on the
fire. I thanked her for the meal. Finally I managed to say what was
on my mind. &ldquo;I want to wish you luck. But I can&rsquo;t put
my whole heart into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile was wan. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She followed me to the
door.</p>

<p>Before I went out I yielded to the final impulse, turned&mdash;found
her right there, hoping. I hugged her for half a minute.</p>

<p>Damn her for being human. But I needed that, too.</p>
