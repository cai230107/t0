<h2 class="chapter">95</h2>

<p>I did not go straight there. I stopped by the apartment,
collected a flask of tea, a gallon of water, a basket of fried
chicken and fried fish, rice and some of Mother Gota&rsquo;s
special baked rocks. I expected a long session. There were things I
wanted to do beyond my expected swift rebuff in a search for
Soulcatcher.</p>

<p>Smoke seemed unchanged. As always. I wondered what he would
remember if, as sometimes happened, one day he just woke up from
his coma. I hear tell people have done that even after being under
years longer than Smoke has.</p>

<p>I filled my stomach with water before I left the apartment. I
took in more fluid when I reached Smoke. I went to work.</p>

<p>Drifting. Quick check of all the villains. Mogaba and
Longshadow, Howler and Narayan Singh and the Daughter of Night were
all acceptably located, either at Overlook or Charandaprash. Blade
was skirting the Shindai Kus with maybe twelve hundred men, trying
to get behind the Prahbrindrah Drah, but the Prince had a screen of
light cavalry out far enough to give him plenty of warning. The man
had a knack.</p>

<p>Before I carried out my obligation to look for Soulcatcher I
took Smoke back in time to see just how early I could find and spy
upon some of the principals. I wanted to see what had happened that
night I had been held captive and tortured. I wanted to unveil the
details of Mogaba&rsquo;s defection.</p>

<p>I found that I could not go back that far.</p>

<p>I recalled that raft on the lake, Mogaba cursing in the
darkness. That had to be it. He should not have been there. What
honest mission could have taken him ashore? Had he changed
allegiances while still holding Dejagore for the good guys? Was his
deal already made when Croaker faced him down? Did he meet the
Howler out there, far enough away that Goblin and One-Eye would not
detect the sorcerer&rsquo;s flying carpet?</p>

<p>Maybe. And if he had that might explain why even Sindawe and
Ochiba were willing to abandon him.</p>

<p>All of us would be dead already and the war long since lost had
Longshadow been in a position to seize that moment.</p>

<p>The cold claws of death may have come closer than ever I had
suspected.</p>

<p>I wish I could have had eyewitness evidence, though.</p>

<p>Smoke can be tricked. And he can be driven by a
sufficiently-determined will.</p>

<p>From the frontiers of past time I raced toward the night of my
despair. I did not drive him to the center of its evil, though.
Instead, I slowed and drifted into an earlier hour, as the
Stranglers first approached the Palace and in best Deceiver form
used two of their number, disguised as holy prostitutes of Bashra
out to perform their obligated random acts of joy, to get close to
the Guards.</p>

<p>But that was not the history I wanted to review. I brought him
forward to the moments of my own interlude upon the sallyport
steps. I watched myself emerge from the Palace, vacantly settle to
the stone. The seizure lasted scarcely a minute, for all the time I
spent amongst the horrors of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Now the slick move. The focus upon the woman in the shadows
across the way, behind the hairy Shadar. The lock onto her despite
Smoke&rsquo;s increasing anxiety and spiritual wriggling.</p>

<p>I never got to know Smoke in full life but, by most accounts, he
had been a pure chickenshit, inalterably opposed to anything that
might involve even the most minor risk to anyone in the court
wizard or fire marshal rackets. Cowardice must have run right down
to the foundations of his being because he writhed like a worm on a
fishhook the whole time I watched Soulcatcher loot his library.</p>

<p>She had no trouble with confusion spells. She had none with
Stranglers, either, though she did encounter a band. They just
gaped at her briefly, then decided their best interests ought to
lead them elsewhere.</p>

<p>She seemed unaware of my scrutiny, unlike that time in the
wheatfield. Could it be that even she was unaware of the secret of
Smoke?</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be lovely?</p>

<p>I watched her for a long time, even after she departed the
Palace. Smoke resisted every second.</p>

<p>Then I went back and had a drink and a snack before I tackled
the more interesting business of tracking Goblin down and, to slake
my own curiosity, having a look at the final falling out between
Croaker and Blade. I had been unable to find witnesses to the
actual explosion.</p>
