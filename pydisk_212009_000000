<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Twenty-nine: SMOKE&rsquo;S HIDEOUT</h2>

<p>Smoke was perched on a tall stool, bent over a huge old book.
The room was filled with books. It looked like a wave of books had
swept in and left tidal pools behind. Not only were there shelves
dripping books, there were books stacked hip-high on the floor,
books on tables and chairs, even books piled on the sill of the
room&rsquo;s one small, high window. Smoke read by the light of a
single candle. The room was sealed so tight the smoke had begun to
irritate his nose and eyes.</p>

<p>From time to time he grunted, made a note on a piece of paper to
his left. He was left-handed.</p>

<p>In all the Palace that room was the best protected from spying
eyes. Smoke had woven webs and walls of spells to secure it. No one
was supposed to know about it. It did not show on any plan of the
Palace.</p>

<p>Smoke felt something touch the outermost of the protective
spells, something as light as a mosquito&rsquo;s weight as it
lands. Before he could swing his attention to it it was gone and he
was not sure he had not imagined it. Since the incident of the
crows and bats he had been almost paranoid.</p>

<p>Intuition told him he had reason. There were forces at work that
were way beyond him. His best weapon was the fact that no one knew
he existed.</p>

<p>He hoped.</p>

<p>He was a very frightened man these days. Terror lurked in every
shadow.</p>

<p>He jumped and squeaked when the door opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You startled me, Radisha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they, Smoke? There&rsquo;s been no word from
Swan. Have they gotten away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving most of their people behind? Radisha, be
patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no patience left. Even my brother is becoming
unsettled. We have only weeks left before the rivers
fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that, madam. Concentrate on what you
can do, not what you wish you could do. Every force possible is
being bent upon them. But we cannot compel them to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Radisha kicked over a pile of books. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
felt so powerless. I don&rsquo;t like the feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoke shrugged. &ldquo;Welcome to the world where the rest of us
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a high corner of the room a point no bigger than a pinprick
oozed something like a black smoke. The smoke slowly filled out the
shape of a small crow. &ldquo;What are the rest of them
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Making preparations for war. In case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder. That black officer. Mogaba. Could he be the
real captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing the things I want them to do. He&rsquo;s
acting like they&rsquo;re going to serve us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes sense, Radisha. If their captain comes back
convinced they can&rsquo;t sneak away, they&rsquo;ll be that much
farther ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he made preparations to run back north?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Radisha looked vexed.</p>

<p>Smoke smiled. &ldquo;Have you considered being forthright with
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a look to chill the bones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought not. Not the way of princes. Too simple. Too
direct. Too logical. Too honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You grow too daring, Smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do. Though as I recall my mandate from your
brother is to remind you occasionally&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are what they pretend to be, you know. Wholly ignorant of their past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that. It makes no difference. They
could become what they were if we let them. Sooner bend the knee to
the Shadowmasters than endure that again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoke shrugged. &ldquo;As you will. Maybe.&rdquo; He smiled
slyly. &ldquo;And as the Shadowmasters will, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am constrained by my need to remain unnoticed, But
I&rsquo;ve been able to catch glimpses of our northern friends.
They have fallen afoul of more of our little friends from the
river. Ferocious things are happening down near the
Main.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorcery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;High magnitude. Recalling that which manifested during
their passage through the pirate swamps. I no longer dare
intrude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn! Damn-damn-damn! Are they all right? Have we lost them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I no longer dare intrude. Time will tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Radisha kicked another pile of books. Smoke&rsquo;s bland
expression cracked, became one of intense irritation. She
apologized. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s frustration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all frustrated. Perhaps you would be less so
if you adjusted your ambitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you followed the course your brother has
charted and aimed to climb but one mountain at a time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! Am I, a woman, the only rooster around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, a woman, will not be required to pay the price of
failure. That will come out of your brother&rsquo;s
purse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you, Smoke! Why are you always right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my commission. Go to your brother. Talk.
Recalculate. Concentrate on the enemy of the moment. The
Shadowmasters must be turned now. The priests will be here forever.
Unless you want shut of them badly enough to let the Shadowmasters
win, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could frame just one High Priest for
treason&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All right. I know. The
Shadowmasters have shown they know what to do with clerics. Nobody
would believe it. I&rsquo;m going. If you dare, find out
what&rsquo;s happening down there. If we&rsquo;ve lost them
we&rsquo;ll have to move quickly. That damned Swan had to go after
them, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does everybody do what I tell them? Some of the
things I say are stupid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Get that grin
off your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smoke failed. &ldquo;Kick over another stack of
books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Radisha huffed out of the room.</p>

<p>Smoke sighed. Then he returned to his reading. The book&rsquo;s
author lingered lovingly over impalements and flayings and tortures
visited on a generation unlucky enough to have lived when the Free
Companies of Khatovar marched out of that strange corner of the
world that spawned them.</p>

<p>The books in that room had been confiscated so they would not
fall into the hands of the Black Company. Smoke did not believe
their being there would keep secrets forever. But maybe long enough
for him to find a way to prevent the sort of bloodshed that had
occurred in olden times. Maybe.</p>

<p>The best hope, though, lay in the probability that the Company
had mutated with time. That it was not wearing a mask. That it had
indeed forgotten its grim origins and its search for its past was
more a reflex than the determined return that other Companies, come
back earlier, had made.</p>

<p>In the back of Smoke&rsquo;s mind, always, was the temptation to
take his own advice, to bring the Company&rsquo;s captain in and
turn him loose on the books, if only to see how he responded to the
truth.</p>
