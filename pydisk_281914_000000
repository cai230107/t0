<a id="p1411" name="p1411"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1411)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1412" name="p1412"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1412)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p1413" name="p1413"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1413)">"We don't have much time," Ahira said, staring out into the night. The rain had faded to a drizzle, but it was enough to mask Jason's trail. Just a couple of miles farther, the forest opened on the cleared land of the holdings outside of Wehnest; he could go in any direction.</p>
<a id="p1414" name="p1414"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1414)">Go after him now? Riding down a forest trail at night was a fine way for horses and people to lose eyes; maybe once they broke through into cleared land they might be able to make some safe progress.</p>
<a id="p1415" name="p1415"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1415)">But cleared land was miles away. It might as well be light-years.</p>
<a id="p1416" name="p1416"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1416)">Ahira didn't like it at all.</p>
<a id="p1417" name="p1417"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1417)">Why did humans have to make a bad situation worse? The dwarf shrugged. It was typical.</p>
<a id="p1418" name="p1418"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1418)">"He might turn back," Aeia said, taking another mouthful of stew. "I doubt it, but he might. Stubbornness runs in the family," she said, a little proudly.</p>
<a id="p1419" name="p1419"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1419)">Bren Adahan shrugged, the flames of the cooking fire dancing in his eyes. He ran dirty fingers through his sandy hair. "I don't see what the problem is. As Mikyn tells it, Jason&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;left after the matter was decided; it wasn't cowardice&#151;"</p>
<a id="p1420" name="p1420"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1420)">"Says you." Walter Slovotsky shook his head. "And says me, for that matter. All it looks like is squeamishness. But what if it looks like cowardice to him?"</p>
<a id="p1421" name="p1421"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1421)">Trust Walter to put his finger right on the problem.</p>
<a id="p1422" name="p1422"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1422)">Adahan didn't understand; he shrugged again. "So? We find him and explain otherwise. It's not uncommon to panic, one's first time in a fight."</p>
<a id="p1423" name="p1423"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1423)">"Tell that to the boy," Ahira said. <i>Please tell that to the boy.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p1424" name="p1424"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1424)">"Very well; I'll go after him," Bren Adahan said, spreading his hands. "But, again, I do not see the problem. We can send easily half a hundred men to find him, persuade him to come back, even force him if they have to."</p>
<a id="p1425" name="p1425"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1425)">Aeia's eyes flashed at that. "Force my brother?"</p>
<a id="p1426" name="p1426"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1426)">"Never mind that, Aeia. Think again, Bren Adahan," Daherrin said. "Think again."</p>
<a id="p1427" name="p1427"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1427)">"Excuse me?"</p>
<a id="p1428" name="p1428"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1428)">"He's telling you to think it through," Aeia said. She spoke slowly, patiently, as though explaining something obvious to a half-witted child. "Jason isn't just my little brother; he's also Karl Cullinane's son&#151;don't you think that any member of the Slavers' Guild would give his right leg to have his hands on the emperor's son?" She swallowed more stew. "It's got to be done fast. We don't have much time until the word gets out."</p>
<a id="p1429" name="p1429"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1429)">That was true. Word of Jason's desertion had quickly spread among the Home warriors&#151;and probably the ex-slaves. Gossip travels at around the speed of sound, even though it feels like the speed of light. Those Therranji heading back to Therranj would quickly spread the story; even those going Home would soon pass the news throughout the valley, and from there to an outbound trader.</p>
<a id="p1430" name="p1430"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1430)">Within weeks, word would be out: Jason Cullinane was traveling. Alone, unprotected.</p>
<a id="p1431" name="p1431"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1431)">When the news reached that bastard Ahrmin, would he try to kidnap the boy to use as a lever to pry Karl out of Holtun-Bieme? Or would he just torture the boy to death, and use that to draw Karl out to where he could be killed?</p>
<a id="p1432" name="p1432"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1432)">Did it matter?</p>
<a id="p1433" name="p1433"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1433)">Ahira shook his head. It didn't look good at all.</p>
<a id="p1434" name="p1434"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1434)">"Got to find him before it's generally known," Daherrin said. He shook his head. "Don't like this much at all; this sorta thing is not my job." He called to his second, "Three or four days until we should be seeing the dragon?"</p>
<a id="p1435" name="p1435"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1435)">"Four," the answer came back. "If he makes it Home on time, and if we get to the rendezvous on time."</p>
<a id="p1436" name="p1436"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1436)">"Ellegon! That's the solution," Bren Adahan said eagerly. "Couldn't Ellegon find him?"</p>
<a id="p1437" name="p1437"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1437)">"Sure." Walter Slovotsky poked a stick into the fire, then pulled it out and considered the glowing ember at its tip. "If they're close enough, Ellegon can read him&#151;the two of them have been around each other since before Jason was born; Ellegon can read him from a greater distance than he can Karl, even. But that's not much; the dragon's got to be reasonably close." Walter shrugged. "Jason can cover a lot of ground in four, five days. Ellegon doesn't dare get too close to towns; he's too liable to get shot out of the sky."</p>
<a id="p1438" name="p1438"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1438)">Ahira nodded. "Let's assume he's going to at least stop off in Wehnest. Maybe we can catch up with him there&#151;we'll bring in some of the slavers' gear, and play merchant as a cover."</p>
<a id="p1439" name="p1439"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1439)">Aeia set her bowl down. "Fine with me."</p>
<a id="p1440" name="p1440"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1440)">Bren and Walter both spoke up. "You are not going," they said in unison.</p>
<a id="p1441" name="p1441"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1441)">"Really. How interesting." Aeia tilted her head as she looked over at Ahira; it was one of Andrea's gestures. "Do you think I'm not going?"</p>
<a id="p1442" name="p1442"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1442)">Ahira didn't like it, but he knew as well as anyone that he didn't have the authority to stop her. Besides, it was a family affair.</p>
<a id="p1443" name="p1443"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1443)">"Aeia," Walter said, "you're not going. And that ends that discussion."</p>
<a id="p1444" name="p1444"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1444)">She stared off into the dark for a moment. "Have you ever heard my father talk about threats, Uncle Walter?"</p>
<a id="p1445" name="p1445"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1445)">Walter frowned.</p>
<a id="p1446" name="p1446"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1446)">"He says," she went on, "that if you make them strong enough, and mean them sincerely enough, you almost never have to follow through. So&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." She eyed him levelly. "If you're going to try to keep me out of this, then you'd better find three or four big men to chain me down, because he's <i>my </i>little brother, and I'm <i>not </i>being left behind," she said, one hand on the butt of her pistol. "And they'd damn well better not want to live, because when I get unchained, I'll kill them. Dead."</p>
<a id="p1447" name="p1447"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1447)">Despite himself, Ahira grinned. He looked over at Walter. "She's going."</p>
<a id="p1448" name="p1448"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1448)">"I worked it out."</p>
<a id="p1449" name="p1449"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1449)">Ahira laughed. "Aeia, I think you've spent too much time around Tennetty. Hmmm&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;who else do we want?"</p>
<a id="p1450" name="p1450"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1450)">Bren Adahan stirred at the ashes. "I'll come. I already said I would."</p>
<a id="p1451" name="p1451"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1451)">Hardly surprising, considering that Aeia was coming.</p>
<a id="p1452" name="p1452"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1452)">"You're in." Ahira nodded. "But we'd better leave it at that: Aeia, Bren Adahan, Walter, and me. Any more, and the size of our group will draw attention. Can't have a whole troop of dwarves marching into Wehnest."</p>
<a id="p1453" name="p1453"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1453)">Walter Slovotsky grinned. "I don't know. It might be kind of fun to see Geveren and the others marching in, singing, 'Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.' Could draw a lot of attention."</p>
<a id="p1454" name="p1454"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1454)">"Shh," Daherrin considered the flames for a moment. "What do we tell the dragon?"</p>
<a id="p1455" name="p1455"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1455)">"Simple," Walter said. "The usual rendezvous south of Wehnest still where it used to be?"</p>
<a id="p1456" name="p1456"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1456)">"No," Daherrin said, then visibly reconsidered. "Well, yeah, if you're thinking of the one we used to use when you were seconding Karl&#151;we just moved it back last year. It's the clearing, just 'bout three days out. Where we first ran into slaver powder, back when <i>he </i>was running the team."</p>
<a id="p1457" name="p1457"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1457)">"Right. So we'll meet Ellegon there."</p>
<a id="p1458" name="p1458"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1458)">Daherrin spat into the fire, a sizzling glob that vanished in a hiss of steam. "That wasn't what I meant. Ellegon isn't going to be happy about losing the boy&#151;what do I tell him?"</p>
<a id="p1459" name="p1459"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1459)">"You just tell him the truth," Ahira said. "The truth. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. With a bit of luck, the truth will be that Jason, Aeia, Bren, Walter, and I are heading back toward Home."</p>
<a id="p1460" name="p1460"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1460)">"Without luck?"</p>
<a id="p1461" name="p1461"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1461)">Ahira picked up a log that was half as thick as his arm. It was a bit long for the fire; he gripped it firmly and snapped it in two. He turned to the others and looked over the faces, shining in the firelight.</p>
<a id="p1462" name="p1462"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1462)">"Without luck, we're all dead."</p>
<a id="p1463" name="p1463"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(1463)">&#160;</p>
