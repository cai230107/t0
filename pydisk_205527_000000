The strong point of Indiana Jones is his ability to exit unharmed from
the most harmful situations. He is not, nevertheless, a superman: if
he can confront and conquer his numerous adversaries it is thanks to
his luck more than physical force. Nevertheless, his physical
qualities are not negligible. Indy is a complete athlete, as shown in
his scores for SIZ and STR. But it is his CON that has to retain our
attention... Thanks to it, Indy has often escaped from the claws of
the death: contrarily to an ordinary player character, Indy does not
recuperate a hit point per day, but rather one every hour of rest,
which means that in 24 hours, he can recover from his injuries and
resume his adventures. More, Indy does not collapse before his hit
points to 0 or below. Even in this case, Indiana Jones is not dead but
resting in a deep coma.  He recuperates 1 "negative" hit point every 3
hours, even if it is to -10.

Example: Indiana Jones is machine-gunned in his apartment.  He is left
for dead at -7 hit points. Indy heals, and 24 hours later, he has the
force to crawl to the telephone to call a physician. But, in order for
this resurrection to be possible, it is necessary that circumstances
be right: if Indy is abandoned in this state at the North Pole or in
the Sahara at noon, he will remain death. Similarly, if he is
pulverized by a bomb or crushed by a trailer, you can consider him
dead if his hit points becomes negative.

The DEX of Indiana Jones, also is exceptional, giving him 60% in
DODGE. It allows it to avoid arms such that javelins, arrows, and even
bullets from a guns (at -20%). On the other hand, do not forget that
Indy is an academic (the doctor Jones), what explains his scores
in INT and EDU.

Indy also possesses a remarkable capacity for adaptation. He can reach
a score of up to 25% in a skill that he did not previously know
provided that he possesses some other skill that is vaguely related,
provided he makes a roll in that other skill.

Example: Fleeing the bad guy, Indy seizes a plane and decides to pilot
it to escape. He has no skill in Pilot Plane (0%), but has a 70% skill
in Drive Automobile. If he succeeds at his Drive Automobile skill he
benefits from a quarter of its percentage to Pilot Plane (ie,
17%). Thanks to luck, if dice rolls are not catastophic, Indy can
pilot the plane high into the sky, and then land it without damage.

This ability of adaptation explains Indy's prodigious gift for
languages.  Indiana Jones speaks all major languages (English, French,
Spanish, German, Russian, etc) to 50 % at least, as well as a great
numbers of small dialects, following the needs of the scenario. In
general, after 48 hours of constant exposure to a language, Indy
already knows the rudiments.
