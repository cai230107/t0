<h2 class="chapter">LXXVIII</h2>

<p>Impressions swirled as Raven toppled from the wall with the
screaming sorceress: ground turning and rushing upward, a windwhale
making its booming protest as its attempt to grab the thing from
the pot was rebuffed.</p>

<p>Impact! He felt his blade reach her spine, going between
vertebrae. He felt his right leg twist beneath her and snap. They
screamed at one another as their faces smashed together.</p>

<p>He got the better of it. He retained consciousness and even a
fragment of will. He dragged himself away, a few feet, started
trying to guess the damage to his leg. Didn&rsquo;t feel like a
compound fracture. Hurt bad enough, though.</p>

<p>Bodies lay all around him. Only Bomanz seemed to be
breathing.</p>

<p>Packing snow around the leg helped numb it a little.</p>

<p>People were yelling above. He saw Case jumping around, waving,
pointing. He looked.</p>

<p>The thing from the pot was coming. It wasn&rsquo;t a hundred
yards away. And nothing seemed able to stop it. Mantas pounded it
with their lightnings. It didn&rsquo;t pay them any attention. It
had only one thought: the silver spike.</p>

<p>Case was trying to get him to get the spike and get it up top
before the thing got hold of it.</p>

<p>Bomanz rolled over, got to his hands and knees, shook his head,
looked around dumbly, spotted the thing, turned almost as pale as
the snow. He croaked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to hold it off. Find
the spike. Get it up to Darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He staggered to his feet, tottered toward the thing.</p>

<p>Raven supposed it really could not be called the Limper anymore,
though the Taken&rsquo;s insanity, ambition, and rage drove it.</p>

<p>He looked for some sign of the spike. The pain in his leg was
the worst he had felt since Croaker had got him with the
Lady&rsquo;s arrow.</p>
