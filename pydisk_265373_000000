<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_3"></a><b>-3-</b></h1>
<a id="p216" name="p216"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(216)">"That is the present situation." Yolyos had their full attention as he stood with one hand resting on the broad back of a carrier robot. "We have managed&#151;or rather Turpyn has&#151;to halt the unloading. And until the ship is emptied, it will remain finned down out there. It is not a passenger ship, but there is a life-unit section in it for emergencies, though we shall find those quarters very crowded if we can retape the ship and take off."</p>
<a id="p217" name="p217"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(217)">Andas considered all the ifs, ands, and buts that now faced them. It would be easy enough to stow aboard in that life section and allow the ship to transport them back. Only that would land them in the hands of the enemy. They must reset the ship with another trip tape. But so far all the cabinets had offered them were broadcasts of code and series of pictures in detail of men and aliens.</p>
<a id="p218" name="p218"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(218)">Watching those as they tested tape after tape, Andas wondered if they would turn up those pertaining to any member of their own small company. So far that had not happened. And Turpyn was raiding more compartments than the first he had opened, now choosing samples in a random fashion.</p>
<a id="p219" name="p219"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(219)">They ate again and, driven by fatigue, slept. And they continued to split into two parties, though Tsiwon at present stayed closer to Andas and his companions. While they kept together, neither Grasty nor the Veep appeared very friendly.</p>
<a id="p220" name="p220"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(220)">It was on the second day that Turpyn admitted defeat. He stood surrounded by gaping drawers, a full tide of discarded tapes rising almost ankle-deep on the floor.</p>
<a id="p221" name="p221"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(221)">"Nothing." He announced failure in a flat voice. "Nothing we can use."</p>
<a id="p222" name="p222"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(222)">Andas spoke up. "We have not tried the ship."</p>
<a id="p223" name="p223"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(223)">"Getting into her will be the problem," but there was a trace of animation in Turpyn's tone. "I have some tech knowledge, but I am no spacer. What of you?" He swung his head slowly, giving each a searching stare.</p>
<a id="p224" name="p224"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(224)">Andas's own experience went no farther than that of a passenger. And he believed no one here could say more, unless Turpyn, in spite of his denial, was holding out on them. To their surprise, Elys spoke first.</p>
<a id="p225" name="p225"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(225)">"I know that the entrance ramps are controlled from within. But certainly this is a problem that must have arisen somewhere, sometime before. Are there no emergency ways to enter a ship?"</p>
<a id="p226" name="p226"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(226)">It was as if her words turned a key deep in Andas's memory. He had a fleeting picture of a ship finned down on a landing strip, a figure climbing by handholds on the outer edge of the fin itself, something he had seen in passing. He had asked an idle question at the time.</p>
<a id="p227" name="p227"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(227)">"The service hatch!"</p>
<a id="p228" name="p228"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(228)">He was not even aware they were all watching him. Surely all ships were general in some points of construction. If so, this one should have the same hatch.</p>
<a id="p229" name="p229"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(229)">"Above the fins." He cut his explanation. "A repair hatch for techs. There's a chance that might open."</p>
<a id="p230" name="p230"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(230)">"Any chance is worth taking now." Tsiwon's usual quaver disappeared in an excitement that strengthened his voice.</p>
<a id="p231" name="p231"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(231)">"At night or at twilight anyway," Yolyos said. When Andas, eager to try to prove his memory right, would have objected, the Salariki pointed out the obvious.</p>
<a id="p232" name="p232"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(232)">"We have no protective clothing. To go out in the glare of that sun and perhaps have to remain in the open working&#151;"</p>
<a id="p233" name="p233"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(233)">He was right. To none of them, different in race and species as they were, did this world hold welcome beyond the door of their prison.</p>
<a id="p234" name="p234"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(234)">And Andas, impatient as he was, was aware of another problem. Once within the repair hatch, if they could find and open that, was there access to the rest of the interior of the ship or only to a confined section for techs? If he, if any one of them, only knew more! The education of an Imperial prince was certainly lacking in survival training. Not that they would speedily die here if they could not find a way out, but perhaps quick death would be better than lingering stagnation.</p>
<a id="p235" name="p235"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(235)">The party attempting to invade the ship narrowed to three&#151;Andas, Yolyos, and Turpyn, whose tech knowledge was indispensable. After the harsh sun that blistered this unknown world set and its glare was gone, they headed for the field.</p>
<a id="p236" name="p236"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(236)">Whatever remote controls triggered the landing of the cargo had not functioned. It was as hatch-sealed as if in space. But they wasted no time in heading directly for the fins. Luckily the winds, with their torturing dryness, had died away, though it still hurt to breathe too deeply, and Andas wondered what long exposure to this atmosphere might do to their bodies.</p>
<a id="p237" name="p237"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(237)">The hand and foot holds were there. Though they did not want to, they must let Turpyn make the first climb, since if the hatch was to be forced, only he could deal with it. Andas swung up close on his heels. He had no trust in the Veep.</p>
<a id="p238" name="p238"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(238)">Clinging to the holds below Turpyn, whom he heard now and then spitting an oath in a tongue not Basic, Andas tried not to breathe too deeply and to ignore the stinging of his nose and the way his eyes teared.</p>
<a id="p239" name="p239"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(239)">Turpyn gave a louder grunt and humped up, Andas quick to follow, with Yolyos behind him. As he pulled within the shell of the ship, he found himself in a narrow passage, so narrow that it was difficult to squeeze through. There was a second hatch Turpyn's torch showed, but the Veep had started to climb again, using more handholds to ascend to the upper levels.</p>
<a id="p240" name="p240"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(240)">So they won through the narrow ways meant only for techs, on major repairs, into the living quarters. After a quick inspection Turpyn gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<a id="p241" name="p241"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(241)">"This has been in use and not too long ago&#151;perhaps on the last trip of the ship. It can be activated with some work. But we shall have to see about the controls. It will do us no good otherwise."</p>
<a id="p242" name="p242"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(242)">They followed him up to the control cabin. There were signs that at times this drone did carry a crew, for webbing seats were slung for both pilot and astrogator before the proper controls.</p>
<a id="p243" name="p243"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(243)">Turpyn pushed past those to stand before the pilot's board, studying the array of buttons and levers. Then he pressed one, and there was an audible click as a trip tape arose from a slot.</p>
<a id="p244" name="p244"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(244)">"If there is a file of these&#151;" He weighed the useless one in his hand. Andas had already started searching by the astrogator's seat. And his prying and pulling at a snug thumbhole paid off. A compartment opened to show in its well-cushioned interior four more tape casings. He clawed the first out to look at the symbol on its side. But he did not recognize it. In fact, they might be entirely off any galactic map he was familiar with. He dropped it to the web seat and picked a second.</p>
<a id="p245" name="p245"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(245)">Again disappointment. No longer did he expect any luck, but perhaps some other of their company would know more. Only&#151;the third! At first he could not believe the report of his eyes, running his finger back and forth to feel the slight roughness of that raised design, assuring himself that it <i>was </i>there.</p>
<a id="p246" name="p246"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(246)">"Inyanga&#151;it is Inyanga!"</p>
<a id="p247" name="p247"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(247)">Yolyos had scooped up the two discarded ones. "And that one&#151;" He pointed to the last in the compartment.</p>
<a id="p248" name="p248"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(248)">"It does not matter!" The prince treasured his find in his two hands lest someone snatch it from him. He had his key to home. "Don't you understand? This will take us to Inyanga&#151;and from there you can reach your own worlds."</p>
<a id="p249" name="p249"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(249)">"Still I am interested." Yolyos secured the last one.</p>
<a id="p250" name="p250"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(250)">"Naul&#151;"</p>
<a id="p251" name="p251"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(251)">Andas held to his tape with a jealous grip. All right, so there was one for Naul. But they would go first to Inyanga.</p>
<a id="p252" name="p252"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(252)">"I think"&#151;the Salariki might have been reading his mind&#151;"that you will find some slight opposition to such a plan, Prince. And we do not know where we are, so that Naul may well be the best and safest choice after all."</p>
<a id="p253" name="p253"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(253)">Yolyos shoved the two unknowns back into the compartment. He kept the one for Naul. But Andas had no intention of surrendering the one he held until he himself dropped it into the right slot and knew the ship was heading for home.</p>
<a id="p254" name="p254"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(254)">Oddly enough, Turpyn paid little attention to their exchange. He was moving around the control cabin testing this lever, pressing that button, as if to assure himself that the ship could be switched from drone to active status. Finally he spoke.</p>
<a id="p255" name="p255"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(255)">"It will do. Cramped quarters for all, and no knowing how long a flight. There ought to be E-rations on board. But we had better see to supplies."</p>
<a id="p256" name="p256"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(256)">They went down into the living space again. As the Veep had pointed out, that section was never meant to house more than four at a time. But to get away from their prison was worth any amount of crowding.</p>
<a id="p257" name="p257"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(257)">There were stored rations, and the air plant was in action, though if their voyage was too long&#151;<i>Was</i> Naul nearer? Perhaps their best chance lay with one of the strange tapes. Yet why would Naul or Inyanga be stored at all unless they were both within easy cruising distance? Only a First-In Scout or a Patrol cruiser carried tapes on long voyages.</p>
<a id="p258" name="p258"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(258)">So reassured, Andas was ready to do battle for his choice as they returned to the prison, this time down the ramp they could lower from within. They found the others waiting eagerly.</p>
<a id="p259" name="p259"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(259)">"Naul, of course," Tsiwon said as if there could be no possible question. "We have excellent transshipping from our ports, and you will have no difficulty in reaching your homes. Also we have a Patrol Sector office. This offence must be reported at once. To discover how deeply this conspiracy has taken root needs expert investigation."</p>
<a id="p260" name="p260"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(260)">"Inyanga's ports are also Sector centers," Andas stuck in, determined to hold his ground. "I see no reason for choosing Naul."</p>
<a id="p261" name="p261"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(261)">"The two of you," Elys said wearily, "can doubtless continue to argue for days. I, for one, have no wish to waste time sitting here listening to you. To my mind, Naul has no advantage over this Inyanga as far as I am concerned, and perhaps that is also true for Chief Councilor Grasty and Lord Yolyos, as well as Veep Turpyn. After all, on my own world I had never heard of either, which means I may have half the galaxy to cover before I reach home. Since we cannot guess where we are at present or in what relation we lie to either of your two worlds, it will be largely a matter of chance as it is."</p>
<a id="p262" name="p262"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(262)">"Naul!"</p>
<a id="p263" name="p263"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(263)">"Inyanga!"</p>
<a id="p264" name="p264"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(264)">Almost in one voice Andas and Tsiwon answered.</p>
<a id="p265" name="p265"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(265)">Yolyos made a sound not far from a growl. "The lady is right. We have two tapes and six of us who may be bound in directly opposite directions. Neither of the ports you urge upon us has any great appeal as far as we are concerned. Therefore, let us let chance decide. Here&#151;" He picked up one of the lidded basins in which their last meal had been delivered. Taking up the cloth that had served as a napkin, he wiped the basin out thoroughly.</p>
<a id="p266" name="p266"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(266)">"Now"&#151;he offered it to Tsiwon, who held to the Naul tape as tightly as Andas did his&#151;"drop it in, Arch Chief. You, too, Prince. We shall have a drawing&#151;"</p>
<a id="p267" name="p267"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(267)">"And who shall do the drawing?" Tsiwon demanded before Andas could. "The lady has been with you, and you&#151;you have been his constant companion." He stabbed a finger at the Salariki and then at Andas.</p>
<a id="p268" name="p268"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(268)">"True enough." Yolyos put the lid back on the basin. "Turpyn, can that robot doing the repairs be activated enough to pick up one of these? We cannot accuse it of any favoritism."</p>
<a id="p269" name="p269"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(269)">"Yes, it can." The Veep sounded almost eager, as if he had despaired of their ever coming to a decision. "Come&#151;"</p>
<a id="p270" name="p270"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(270)">With all of them watching, Yolyos placed the basin, uncovered once more, where the robot stood. Andas and Tsiwon dropped in the tapes. One of the tentacle arms that had been so long raised in the air dropped the small tool it held and descended to the basin after Turpyn had made the adjustments he thought necessary. It raised jerkily again, one of the tapes gripped fast. The Veep hastened to kill the power, and Yolyos pried the selection loose.</p>
<a id="p271" name="p271"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(271)">"Inyanga," he informed them.</p>
<a id="p272" name="p272"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(272)">Tsiwon could not say that the choice had not been fair. But his expression was sour, and he took the rejected tape, holding it as if with it in his possession he might still have a chance to use it.</p>
<a id="p273" name="p273"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(273)">They had no luggage, but they raided the food room, bringing with them all that was container-stored. The harsh dawn was breaking when they finally climbed the ramp into the ship and somehow fitted themselves into the life section. There was some relief from the crowding when Turpyn, Yolyos, and Andas went to the control cabin. Though he was no astrogator, the tall Salariki settled in that seat, while Andas took the stand-by officer's seat just behind. Turpyn was in the pilot's place. The prince watched the Veep slip in the tape and set the auto-pilot to take off.</p>
<a id="p274" name="p274"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(274)">The warning sounded, and they strapped in, ready for the force of the blast. When that came, Andas found the strain to be far worse than he expected. There was less cushioning that eased the passengers through this ordeal than on the usual flight.</p>
<a id="p275" name="p275"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(275)">He aroused groggily only to discover another difference between this and the transportation he had been used to. There was no artificial gravity in the drone, and he had to adjust to weightlessness. The ensuing period of time was a new form of torment.</p>
<a id="p276" name="p276"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(276)">Among the others, Yolyos, though he admitted he had not met this before, was the first to learn to handle himself in space. Tsiwon, Grasty, and Elys felt it the most. They had no drugs such as were normally issued, nor voyage-sleep, which was the final refuge of those who could not stand the physical discomfort.</p>
<a id="p277" name="p277"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(277)">The monotony itself was hard. Elys and Tsiwon stayed mostly in their bunks. The other four, though Grasty grunted and groaned and was as uncooperative as he dared be, took turns sharing the other two sleeping places. Time had no meaning. There was no ship's timer to cut the crawling period into night and day. There was sleep, but one could only do so much of that, and Andas found it harder and harder.</p>
<a id="p278" name="p278"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(278)">Grasty's eternal grumbling was so much a source of tension that at times Andas found himself having to use all his control not to turn on the man with a blow across his whining mouth. Turpyn, once he had taken them into space, said little or nothing. If he had the use of a bunk, he slept; if not, he slouched in one of the webbed seats of the control cabin, his eyes still closed for most of the time. Andas suspected that the Veep was engaged in thoughts he had no intentions of sharing with his ill-assorted companions.</p>
<a id="p279" name="p279"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(279)">There remained Yolyos, though the Salariki had his periods of deep silence also, and Andas respected them. But when he was willing to talk, he described a new way of life with barbed humor. Andas found himself babbling away on the state of an Imperial prince, with a tongue loose enough to shame him now and then. He had never believed that talkativeness was one of his faults, but now it seemed a major one.</p>
<a id="p280" name="p280"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(280)">"Have you thought"&#151;the Salariki advanced a thorny question&#151;"of what might have occurred during your absence, always supposing that our time differences are true?"</p>
<a id="p281" name="p281"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(281)">Andas had, though he did not want to. Suppose he had just vanished? Then they would have selected one of the other princes as heir. But what if there had been an android in his place&#151;then he must prove substitution. There was a way. He glanced around, for they were in the control cabin. Neither Turpyn nor Grasty was present. He could not conceive of the Chief Councilor ever successfully playing eavesdropper. His wheezing at the slightest movement in free fall heralded his presence in a way that could not be concealed. Turpyn was another matter, but by swinging his web seat around a little, Andas could be sure that the Veep could not come swimming into the cabin without his knowledge.</p>
<a id="p282" name="p282"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(282)">As for Yolyos, somehow, with the alien Andas had not the least fear of being frank. The Salariki had no ties with the empire, and the more Andas saw of him, the more he found him the most congenial of this company. Also there was some pressure in Andas himself driving him to talk, as if by discussing a few concrete plans aloud, he could ensure their success.</p>
<a id="p283" name="p283"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(283)">"There is more to the Triple Towers than most of those who live within their walls know. Building has spread far beyond the original towers&#151;like throwing a stone in a pool and watching the ripples run out. Only those ripples are walls, pavilions, gardens, halls, audience chambers beyond number. No one, I am certain, knows them in entirety. There would be surprises even for the Emperor. Parts have been closed from use for generations. There have been ill doings in the past, and portions have been shunned because of the tales of slayings and worse, for the royal clans have warred among themselves for generations. Some parts of our history have been deliberately suppressed or altered, so the truth is lost.</p>
<a id="p284" name="p284"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(284)">"But fragments are rediscovered. We do not inherit from father to son as in some monarchies, which is the simpler and more direct fashion. The son of an emperor's sister, always providing that her marriage has been within a defined circle of the royal clans, may have first consideration. However, the sister of the present emperor has no sons, so the choice has reverted to the second line of sons. But it is the Emperor's duty to select his heir in good time and see him crowned as throne-son before the families of the Hundred Names. Once that is done, to dispute his right is treason.</p>
<a id="p285" name="p285"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(285)">"I am one of three&#151;four if you count Anakue, even though his line is illegitimate. It was a surprise to all when Akrama the Light-Holder summoned me. The Emperor waited a long time before he announced he would name his heir. There have been many urging a need on him&#151;especially with Anakue leading what is close to rebel forces. Three years ago there was an uprising in Anakue's name on Benin. It took four regiments of the Inner Guard to put that down. But he denied all knowledge of it, and there was no one, even among the Eyes and the Ears, to tie him to it.</p>
<a id="p286" name="p286"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(286)">"If I just disappeared, then it may be that Jassar or Yuor is now the Imperial Prince. That I must discover before I make myself known. Which means I shall make use of the secret ways to learn what has happened."</p>
<a id="p287" name="p287"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(287)">"Secret ways? You know such?"</p>
<a id="p288" name="p288"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(288)">"By luck I do. It is almost as if I have been prepared by fortune for what has happened. My father was a recluse. Shortly after my birth, within two years of his marriage to his cousin, the Princess Anneta, the daughter of a former emperor, he was injured in an explosion of his private flitter. He was one of the unfortunate few who cannot tolerate plasta-flesh transplants, and his face was terribly scarred without hope of recovery. My mother was very young and of such a nature that she had accepted her marriage as a duty that she took no joy in. Also she found disfigurement in others made her ill. Realizing this, my father forswore her with honor and withdrew to one of the remote and half-forgotten portions of the palace, such as I mentioned.</p>
<a id="p289" name="p289"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(289)">"His one pleasure in life became history, first of the empire, and then of the Triple Towers and the intrigues and secrets of the royal clans. Since he was second son to the Emperor, his position was secure, and he lived undisturbed.</p>
<a id="p290" name="p290"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(290)">"In fact, he was largely forgotten as the years passed, keeping his own small court apart from the general life of the Triple Towers. And I lived in that solitude, with nurses and then with tutors he selected, until I was of an age to be sent to Pav for warrior training. I never saw my father without a mask fashioned by one of the great artists of the court, which gave him a semblance of the handsome face he had once had. But I learned to know him as well as he would allow anyone to penetrate to his private world.</p>
<a id="p291" name="p291"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(291)">"Part of his training for me was the rediscovery of palace secrets. There were hidden ways within the walls, spy holes through which one might watch, even chambers with secret doors in which were stacked weapons of another time, or treasure. And he made me memorize each new one he discovered. I do not know how his passion for the strange research developed, but he was certain that such knowledge would be of benefit to him who knew it. And it finally brought about his own death."</p>
<a id="p292" name="p292"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(292)">Andas no longer saw the Salariki's face, the searching brilliant eyes. His attention was for a mind picture that had mercifully begun to dull a little now, but that he would never forget.</p>
<a id="p293" name="p293"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(293)">"How?" Yolyos asked. "Or is that something you do not wish to speak of?"</p>
<a id="p294" name="p294"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(294)">"For a time I could not. I know it, and one other&#151;Hamnaki, who was my father's personal servant. We&#151;I had come back on leave from Pav&#151;missed him all through one day. So at last we took torches and started hunting the ways. We found him in a newly discovered section, but it had been designed by some builder who was more suspicious of mind or had a greater and darker secret to hide, for there was a man trap set within. There was only the belief that he died instantly to comfort us. We got him out and said that he had died of a fever. Since no one any longer cared or remembered him much, there was no question. They gave him a funeral of state as was his right and a lesser name-carving in the temple. Do you know, until I saw that in place, I had not even known my father had the right to wear the two plumes. He had won that during the pirate invasion of Darfur&#151;but no one had ever told me.</p>
