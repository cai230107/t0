      THIS PLANET,<br>
      HUMANS HAD FORGOTTEN<br>
      THEIR HERITAGE—<br>
      UNTIL IT CAME<br>
      LOOKING FOR THEM!</h3>
        <p>After the collapse of the galactic Web, civilizations crumbled and
        chaos reigned on thousands of planets. Only on planet Bellevue was there
        a difference. There, a Fleet Battle Computer named Center had survived
        from the old civilization. When it found Raj Whitehall, the man who
        could execute its plan for reviving human civilization, he and Center
        started Bellevue back on the road leading to the stars; and when
        Bellevue reached that goal, Center sent copies of itself and Raj to the
        thousands of worlds still waiting for the light of civilization to dawn.</p>
        <p>On Hafardine, civilization had fallen further than most. That men
        came from the stars was not even a rumor of memory in Adrian Gellert's
        day. The Empire of Vanbret spread across the lands in a sterile splendor
        that could only end in another collapse, more ignominious and complete
        than the first. Adrian Gellert was a philosopher, a Student of the
        Grove. His greatest desire was a life of contemplation in the service of
        wisdom . . . until he touched the 'holy relic' that contained the
        disincarnate minds of Raj Whitehall and Center. On that day, Adrian's
        search for wisdom would lead him to a life of action, from the
        law-courts of Vanbret to the pirate cities of the Archipelago and
        battlefields bloodier than any in the history he'd learned. The prize
        was the future of humanity.</p>
