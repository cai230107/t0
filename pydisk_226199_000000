<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_77"></a><b>Chapter 77</b></h1>
<a id="p5615" name="p5615"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5615)">Maria went to the door to answer the knock. It wasn't Anastasia, the young Corfiote girl who looked after old Mrs. Grisini. She always knocked firmly, and in a recognizable pattern. A pity; she'd have loved to ask her to mind Umberto and maybe even Alessia, if the old lady was asleep. She really had to go up to the temple again. Umberto was up&#151;and then down&#151;and she didn't know who else to turn to. But this was a very quiet knock. Tentative.</p>
<a id="p5616" name="p5616"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5616)">She opened the door to see Benito standing there. "What are you doing out of bed?"</p>
<a id="p5617" name="p5617"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5617)">"No one's asked me into one," he said with his old impish grin. "Even the monks have chased me out."</p>
<a id="p5618" name="p5618"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5618)">His face became earnest. "Maria, before I left Venice for the first time, Petro said I should come and see you and offer to baby-sit. Before I left Venice this time an undine called Juliette charged me with seeing to Alessia's welfare. I'm better. But I'm still forbidden drill or to do too much exercise. So I came to do what Petro and Juliette said I must. I've come to baby-sit."</p>
<a id="p5619" name="p5619"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5619)">Maria gaped at him. "You can't be serious!"</p>
<a id="p5620" name="p5620"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5620)">Benito shrugged. "As much as I ever am. Petro Dorma's no fool, as I learned eventually. And I sort of made a bargain with Juliette. So: Lead me to it. Tell me what to do, and you go out and get some time off."</p>
<a id="p5621" name="p5621"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5621)">Maria held her head and shook it, as if to check that it was still attached to her shoulders. "Holy Mother! I don't believe this. Look, Umberto's not so good today, either. I've promised him I'd look in at the Little Arsenal, see how thing are going. I've, um, got another visit I really need to make. 'Lessi's asleep now. But would you stay with her and Umberto? If you mean it, that is?"</p>
<a id="p5622" name="p5622"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5622)">He smiled. For once, it was a smile with no overtones, no sense of anything hidden, and nothing of his mad recklessness in it. "I mean it. Like I said, lead me to it."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5623" name="p5623"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5623)">When Maria came back, guiltily, knowing that she'd been away for longer than she'd meant to be, she heard laughter from inside her new home. She found Benito had Umberto sitting up against the cushions in the bedroom, while he was executing intricate Venetian dance steps with Alessia in his arms.</p>
<a id="p5624" name="p5624"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5624)">"She's a better dancer than you are," said Maria, trying not to join in the laughter.</p>
<a id="p5625" name="p5625"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5625)">"She couldn't be worse!" Benito grinned. "I absolutely hated the dancing instructions that Dorma's mother made me suffer through. Marco now, he makes it look easy. Here, Maria. I think she's getting hungry."</p>
<a id="p5626" name="p5626"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5626)">"He even changed her, Maria," said Umberto wonderingly. "He's a braver man than I."</p>
<a id="p5627" name="p5627"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5627)">Maria thought Umberto was looking a great deal better than when she'd left.</p>
<a id="p5628" name="p5628"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5628)">Benito wrinkled his nose. "You've just got to switch your senses off, sort of. Make it just a job to be gotten through. It's no worse than a lot of other things I've done, and better than no few."</p>
<a id="p5629" name="p5629"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5629)">Maria shook her head at him. "Just when I think I know how your mind works, Benito, you go and surprise me again. I never thought you'd be any good with children."</p>
<a id="p5630" name="p5630"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5630)">Benito looked like mischief incarnate. "It's because they trust me. Nobody else does."</p>
<a id="p5631" name="p5631"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5631)">Maria snorted. "And that's no surprise!"</p>
<a id="p5632" name="p5632"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5632)">"Now Maria," said Umberto gently. "He's made me laugh. I'll say I feel better for it."</p>
<a id="p5633" name="p5633"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5633)">Maria gave Benito a reluctant smile. "Oh, he's not all bad. Just half bad. Now, I'm going to feed Alessia. Excuse me."</p>
<a id="p5634" name="p5634"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5634)">Benito gave her a little bow. "I'll take my leave, too, Umberto, Maria. I'll take a look in down at the Little Arsenal, Umberto. I want to see those boats."</p>
<a id="p5635" name="p5635"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5635)">"Come back and tell me what you think."</p>
<a id="p5636" name="p5636"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5636)">Maria walked him to the door. Bit her lip, looking at him. "Thanks," she said quietly.</p>
<a id="p5637" name="p5637"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5637)">He shrugged. "It's nothing. I'll come again, if you like. Umberto kind of surprised me. He's got interesting ideas about those fireboats."</p>
<a id="p5638" name="p5638"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5638)">That had surprised her too. "He looks better for the visit. But next time let me show you how to fold a napkin." It was a tacit admission that she wouldn't object to a next time, she thought, as she patted Alessia's derriere. "This is a mess."</p>
<a id="p5639" name="p5639"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5639)">"So was what I found there, believe me. I'll see you."</p>
<a id="p5640" name="p5640"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5640)">He probably wouldn't, she thought. He'd be off on his next madcap stunt, which would be far more interesting than looking after a sick man and a baby.</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5641" name="p5641"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5641)">"And where have you been, young feller-me-lad?" asked Manfred, with a buffet that would have made Benito's ears ring for a good while if he hadn't ducked. "Enjoying the adulation of the admiring young women of the Citadel? Francesca tells me you're a very sought-after young bachelor."</p>
<a id="p5642" name="p5642"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5642)">Benito grinned. "It's hard being popular. If only you weren't seven sizes too big you could try it." He ducked again. "Listen, seriously, do you know about the project they've been busy with at the Little Arsenal? The fireboats?</p>
<a id="p5643" name="p5643"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5643)">Manfred shook his head. "No. And whose project is this?"</p>
<a id="p5644" name="p5644"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5644)">"That's just it: The Arsenalotti have been at odds with the captain-general. So they've been doing it on their own. They've got nearly thirty of these things built. They reckon they've materials for twice that. They're smallish boats&#151;long and slim and designed for speed. Umberto&#151;Maria Verrier's husband&#151;designed the things. I've just been down to have a look. The guy is good, Manfred. Those things, with a good following wind, will be like arrows."</p>
<a id="p5645" name="p5645"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5645)">"And just how are we supposed to launch these arrows?" asked Falkenberg, curiously. "Hold the beach while they're carried outside?"</p>
<a id="p5646" name="p5646"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5646)">"They've been built to be lowered over the wall into the water. He got the idea from Erik and me and our coracle stunt. Except they're making davits and winches. One of the men down at the Little Arsenal was showing me.</p>
<a id="p5647" name="p5647"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5647)">"And you say they've kept this in the dark?"</p>
<a id="p5648" name="p5648"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5648)">"Not deliberately. They were just looking for an opportunity to bring it up."</p>
<a id="p5649" name="p5649"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5649)">"With Tomaselli in charge, that won't happen," said Falkenberg. "Not that it isn't a good idea. Might be, at least. Take me down for a look in sometime, Benito."</p>
<div align="center">* * *</div>
<a id="p5650" name="p5650"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5650)">Count Mindaug was scowling fiercely. Given the slight distortion always present in the summoned image above the blood-bowl, the expression made him look even uglier than ever.</p>
<a id="p5651" name="p5651"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5651)">"I hadn't thought he'd be this cautious, Elizabeth," Mindaug admitted. "By now, I'd expected Jagiellon to have intervened directly."</p>
<a id="p5652" name="p5652"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5652)">The countess decided that her silvery laugh would irritate Mindaug too much, at the moment. So she kept her expression simply serene. "Keep in mind, Kazimierz, that <i>Chernobog</i> is ancient, even if the shell he inhabits&#151;that thing that used to be the prince Jagiellon&#151;is still a relatively young man. For demons, 'ancient' and 'prudent' are almost synonyms. Even for a demon with a savage temper like his."</p>
<a id="p5653" name="p5653"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5653)">"True enough. Still&#151;"</p>
<a id="p5654" name="p5654"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5654)">"Give it time. Which we have, by the way. Months yet, probably. The attempted treason failed, and my agent in the fortress informs me that any further attempts will take considerable time to organize. Unfortunately&#151;or perhaps fortunately, given Chernobog's hesitancy&#151;the woman who is running the Citadel's counterespionage work is extremely astute."</p>
<a id="p5655" name="p5655"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5655)">Mindaug's eyebrows rose. "A <i>woman? </i>Since when do Venetians&#151;"</p>
<a id="p5656" name="p5656"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5656)">"She's not Venetian. She's one of the Imperials. Prince Manfred's leman, to boot, so she has plenty of influence. Her name is Francesca de Chevreuse. The name she goes by, I should say, since I doubt very much it's her real one."</p>
<a id="p5657" name="p5657"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5657)">Now, the Count was shaking his head. For a moment, the tips of his sharp-filed teeth showed. "What is the world coming to? In the old days&#151;yourself excepted, of course&#151;women handled the gossip, not the statecraft."</p>
<a id="p5658" name="p5658"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5658)">Since Mindaug's mood seemed to be improving, Elizabeth issued her silvery laugh. "Don't be silly. Even in Lithuania, that's not true. Or have you already forgotten Grand Duchess Imenilda?"</p>
<a id="p5659" name="p5659"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5659)">"That was almost a century ago. Besides, she was Ruthenian. The Ruthenians have always been a peculiar lot. Meaning no offense." Elizabeth Bartholdy had quite a bit of Ruthenian blood in her own ancestry.</p>
<a id="p5660" name="p5660"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5660)">"None taken, I assure you. To get back to the point, Kazimierz, I really think you're worrying too much."</p>
<a id="p5661" name="p5661"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5661)">Count Mindaug studied her for a moment. Then said abruptly: "That may be, Elizabeth. But the fact remains that I now need to consider, seriously, the consequences of failure. If this trap of yours doesn't work&#151;even if only because Jagiellon avoids it&#151;I will be the one to face the immediate repercussions. Not you." He raised his hand and eyed it. "Granted, it's not the finest skin in the world, but it's the only one I've got. I'd just as soon avoid having it served up for one of the monster's meals."</p>
<a id="p5662" name="p5662"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5662)">He lowered the hand and brought his eyes back to hers. "I'll need to run, Elizabeth&#151;which means I'll need a place to run <i>to.</i>"</p>
<a id="p5663" name="p5663"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5663)">The countess ran a delicate fingertip across her lower lip, thinking. She was not surprised, of course, that the issue had finally come up. She'd already given it quite a bit of thought herself, in fact.</p>
<a id="p5664" name="p5664"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5664)">"You understand that I do not share your interest in territorial and material matters?"</p>
<a id="p5665" name="p5665"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5665)">Mindaug's pointed teeth showed again. "You're not <i>that </i>indifferent to them, Elizabeth. Or do you really think you'd be able to pursue your own interests&#151;if you were a peasant woman?"</p>
<a id="p5666" name="p5666"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5666)">She laughed. "Point taken. Nevertheless&#151;"</p>
<a id="p5667" name="p5667"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5667)">He was shaking his head. "I'm well aware that your ambitions and mine are different. All the more reason, it seems to me, that there needn't be any clash between us. Even if&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;how to say it? Even if&#151;"</p>
<a id="p5668" name="p5668"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5668)">"Even if you were residing in the Carpathians instead of Vilna&#151;and trying to subvert my great-great-nephew and assume the throne of Hungary, instead of Jagiellon's."</p>
<a id="p5669" name="p5669"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5669)">"That's putting it bluntly. But&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;yes."</p>
<a id="p5670" name="p5670"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5670)">He waited, his face impassive.</p>
<a id="p5671" name="p5671"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5671)">Elizabeth thought a moment further, then shrugged. "I can't say I have any particular attachment to Emeric. He's easier to manipulate than you would be, but on the other hand&#160;.&#160;.&#160;."</p>
<a id="p5672" name="p5672"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5672)">Mindaug finished the thought for her. "I'm smarter than he is. Which means I'd cause fewer messes for you to have to manipulate me out of." He left unspoken the obvious final clause: <i>assuming you could.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p5673" name="p5673"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5673)">But Elizabeth was not worried about that. And the more she thought about it, the more she could see a number of advantages to having Mindaug&#151;if necessary, which she still didn't think it would be&#151;taking asylum and refuge with her.</p>
<a id="p5674" name="p5674"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5674)">"Done, then. That <i>assumes, </i>of course, that our plans fail."</p>
<a id="p5675" name="p5675"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5675)">"Needless to say. I assure you, Elizabeth, that I'd much prefer to remain in Vilna, if at all possible. If nothing else, I'm too old to take any pleasure at the thought of a frantic race to get out of Lithuania ahead of Jagiellon's wrath."</p>
<a id="p5676" name="p5676"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5676)">"<i>Chernobog</i>'s wrath, Kazimierz. Don't ever forget who you're really dealing with."</p>
<a id="p5677" name="p5677"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5677)">For the first time, he laughed himself. "No chance of that, Elizabeth! It's why I approached you in the first place. A mere Grand Duke, even one as capable and vicious as Jagiellon, I would have been confident of handling on my own."</p>
<a id="p5678" name="p5678"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5678)">He glanced aside, as if looking over his shoulder. "I simply prefer to avoid the name, that's all. The Black Brain is near to me, and it never pays to do anything to tingle its attention. Speaking of which&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." His hands began moving. "I think it's time to end this discussion."</p>
<a id="p5679" name="p5679"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5679)">Within seconds, his image had faded away.</p>
<a id="p5680" name="p5680"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5680)">&#160;</p>
