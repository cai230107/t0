<h3 align="center"><b><i>Return to Pandathaway</i></b></h3>
<blockquote>
<a id="p2400" name="p2400"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2400)" style="text-indent:0"><i>Every once in a while, I wake up and realize where I am and what I'm doing, and then it occurs to me: Stash and Emma Slovotsky's baby boy is an asshole.&#160;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p2401" name="p2401"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2401)" align="right" style="text-indent:0">&#151;Walter Slovotsky</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="p2402" name="p2402"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2402)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p2403" name="p2403"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2403)">&#160;</p>
<a id="p2404" name="p2404"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2404)">Walter Slovotsky had wanted to stay in the Inn of Quiet Repose, but Ahira had overruled him: granted, they hadn't been in Pandathaway for years, but Tommallo might recognize them.</p>
<a id="p2405" name="p2405"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2405)">Still, they would have to make up their minds and make their arrangements soon; it was late afternoon, and the sun sat only about ten degrees above the horizon.</p>
<a id="p2406" name="p2406"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2406)">He stretched his arms as he sat on the passenger's side of the flatbed wagon, then continued the motion to grab the muslin sack of jerky behind the bench seat. After serving himself, he offered the bag around; everyone else declined, except for Tennetty.</p>
<a id="p2407" name="p2407"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2407)">"Still think it'd be worth a try."</p>
<a id="p2408" name="p2408"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2408)">It had been years and years since they'd first come through Pandathaway, but Walter could still remember the meal they'd had in the inn. Wonderful, wonderful food.</p>
<a id="p2409" name="p2409"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2409)">"We'll try another inn," the dwarf said, bouncing up and down on the back of his pony. "Nearer the docks. We'll want to sell our cargo, as long as we're here. But I don't want to take any chances on being made. Understood?"</p>
<a id="p2410" name="p2410"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2410)">Bren Adahan twitched his reins. "What's the difference? There's no price on your head."</p>
<a id="p2411" name="p2411"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2411)">"Not specifically," the dwarf admitted. "But the Slavers' Guild still has a reward out for Home warriors. I think we qualify, so we'll keep a low profile."</p>
<a id="p2412" name="p2412"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2412)">"Right," Tennetty said, sitting next to him, as she drove their flatbed wagon. She flicked the switch at the left drayhorse; the animal lowered its head and slogged on. "That's my vote."</p>
<a id="p2413" name="p2413"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2413)">Walter had to repress a chuckle at the way she kept a lock of hair in front of the right side of her face, concealing her glass eye; she looked sort of like Veronica Lake.</p>
<a id="p2414" name="p2414"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2414)">A wiry, scarred, completely unpretty Veronica Lake, who could as easily slit your throat as look at you.</p>
<a id="p2415" name="p2415"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2415)">Her level look at him said it all: <i>I don't like you much, either.</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p2416" name="p2416"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2416)">"I didn't think it was a voting matter," Aeia said, with a sly smile. "Isn't this supposed to be a led party?"</p>
<a id="p2417" name="p2417"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2417)">"Shut up," Walter explained, returning her smile with interest.</p>
<a id="p2418" name="p2418"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2418)">Things had settled down to a relatively stable set of relationships. Whatever Aeia had said to Bren Adahan while Walter had been off in Holtun-Bieme was working: As long as Walter didn't rub Adahan's nose in what he and Aeia were doing, Adahan seemed resolved to ignore it.</p>
<a id="p2419" name="p2419"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2419)">Bren Adahan's brow wrinkled for a moment; his face brightened. "Let me make the arrangements for housing; I have an idea."</p>
<a id="p2420" name="p2420"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2420)">Ahira nodded, bouncing up and down on the back of his pony. "Sure. Meet us in Dolphin Plaza. It's down by the docks."</p>
<a id="p2421" name="p2421"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2421)">"If you can't meet us there, try at the steps of the Great Library," Walter put in. It wasn't impossible that that place had been torn down or something; best to allow for an alternative.</p>
<a id="p2422" name="p2422"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2422)">Adahan spurred his horse. Aeia, after a glance toward and a nod from the dwarf, went after him. Walter Slovotsky approved; she made a good brake on Adahan. Or anyone else, for that matter.</p>
<a id="p2423" name="p2423"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2423)">Tennetty chuckled ruefully. "Like a couple of puppies, them two." She eyed Walter speculatively. "She any good?"</p>
<a id="p2424" name="p2424"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2424)">"None of your business."</p>
<a id="p2425" name="p2425"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2425)">"Hey, Walter, ta havath." Tennetty shrugged. "I like them young, too."</p>
<a id="p2426" name="p2426"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2426)">"Boys or girls?" he asked, then immediately regretted it as her face clouded over. But he couldn't resist adding, "Careful, careful, Tennetty&#151;you're in disguise, remember. Slitting the throat of a robust fellow like myself might draw some attention."</p>
<a id="p2427" name="p2427"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2427)">"I won't always be in disguise."</p>
<a id="p2428" name="p2428"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2428)">"<i>Enough, </i>the two of you," the dwarf said, shaking his head. Then: "Damn you, ease up," as his gray gelding half-reared, spooked by a something small and furry that scampered across the filthy street.</p>
<a id="p2429" name="p2429"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2429)">"Fine," Tennetty whispered. "We'll settle up for this some other time. When I clear it with Karl."</p>
<a id="p2430" name="p2430"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2430)">"If."</p>
<a id="p2431" name="p2431"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2431)">"When."</p>
<a id="p2432" name="p2432"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2432)">Walter didn't understand Tennetty. As devoted as she was to Karl Cullinane, the notion of the big man riding into the jaws of a trap didn't bother her. It was as though Karl was a force of nature, not merely a very tough man.</p>
<a id="p2433" name="p2433"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2433)">The dwarf squinted at a broadside, pasted against the building ahead. "Does that&#151;<i>shit."</i>&#160;</p>
<a id="p2434" name="p2434"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2434)">&#160;</p>

<a id="p2448" name="p2448"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2448)">Walter vaulted from the wagon and studied the paper for a long moment. Too fast, this was all happening too damn fast. There must have been some spies in Holtun-Bieme, spies ready to drop their cover and gallop away. Probably even some sort of pony-express-style relay; otherwise the news couldn't have gotten here so quickly.</p>
<a id="p2449" name="p2449"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2449)">A tall man, wearing the steel helmet and the center-ridged breastplate of Pandathaway's police force, walked up to where Walter and the dwarf stood.</p>
<a id="p2450" name="p2450"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2450)">"Interested?"</p>
<a id="p2451" name="p2451"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2451)">It took Walter a millisecond to slip into character: "Of course I am," he said, hitching at his swordbelt.</p>
<a id="p2452" name="p2452"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2452)">"You're too late," the guardsman said. "They left two days ago. Are you any good with that sword?"</p>
<a id="p2453" name="p2453"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2453)">Walter drew himself up straight. "Sir, I am Warrel of Horelt village. <i>The </i>Warrel of Horelt village."</p>
<a id="p2454" name="p2454"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2454)">The guard shrugged&#151;"Never heard of you"&#151;and walked away.</p>
<a id="p2455" name="p2455"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2455)">As soon as the soldier was out of sight, Ahira threw back his head and laughed. "<i>The </i>Warrel of Horelt village?" Ahira asked. "Really? Not <i>the </i>Warrel of Horelt village?"</p>
<a id="p2456" name="p2456"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2456)">Even Tennetty grinned. "And I thought you were just a useless piece of meat."</p>
<a id="p2457" name="p2457"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2457)">Walter Slovotsky shrugged. "Well, now that he's put me down, he's going to forget about me: I'm just some local champion who's come to Pandathaway to show off."</p>
<a id="p2458" name="p2458"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2458)">Tennetty nodded. "Clever. Very clever. What do we do now?"</p>
<a id="p2459" name="p2459"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2459)">This screwed things up profoundly. They could switch gears and go searching for Jason, but the Home searchers could handle that.</p>
<a id="p2460" name="p2460"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2460)">The important point was that any chance of delaying or sabotaging the slaver hunters was gone with Ahrmin and his hunters. Unless, of course, they gave chase.</p>
<a id="p2461" name="p2461"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2461)">Walter shrugged. "Guess we've got to find a fast ship that's heading for Melawei."</p>
<a id="p2462" name="p2462"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2462)">"Whether they know it yet or not," Tennetty said, eyeing the edge of a knife that Walter hadn't seen her draw, hadn't known she had.</p>
<a id="p2463" name="p2463"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2463)">The dwarf eyed the setting sun. "Well, we're not going to get out of here today. Let's go find the kids."</p>
<a id="p2464" name="p2464"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2464)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p2465" name="p2465"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2465)">Aeia and Bren Adahan were waiting for them in Dolphin Square.</p>
<a id="p2466" name="p2466"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2466)">Walter sighed. Some things seemed to improve with age. Some things <i>were </i>improved with age. And some were just fucked with until all their charm was gone.</p>
<a id="p2467" name="p2467"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2467)">The Dolphin Fountain was one of the last.</p>
<a id="p2468" name="p2468"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2468)">Years before, the center of the fountain had consisted of a gorgeous pair of marble dolphins, spouting water into both the breeze and the fountain. The dark-veined white marble, carved simply and elegantly, had glistened in the sunlight; stray traces of mist had refreshed him as he'd watched the smiling statues that were more dolphins frozen in midleap than cold stone.</p>
<a id="p2469" name="p2469"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2469)">In the interim, some soulless criminal had gilded the statues; some unfeeling murderer of beauty had covered the innocent marble with gold leaf. It was probably the same boob of a sculptor with no fire in his veins who had carved miniatures of the dolphins into the edge of the fountain itself, in an awkward bas-relief that looked like a school of hopping minnows.</p>
<a id="p2470" name="p2470"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2470)">The fountain was a caricature of its former self. It was almost enough to make Walter cry.</p>
<a id="p2471" name="p2471"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2471)">"Have you ever seen anything like this?" Aeia asked, smiling up at him. "Isn't it gorgeous?"</p>
<a id="p2472" name="p2472"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2472)">"No, I haven't," Walter said, keeping his voice flat and level. "It's unique."</p>
<a id="p2473" name="p2473"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2473)">"I have arranged lodging for us," Bren Adahan said. "A suite of rooms in the Inn of Quiet Repose."</p>
<a id="p2474" name="p2474"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2474)">"I thought I told you no on that." Ahira shook his head. "Tommallo knows us."</p>
<a id="p2475" name="p2475"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2475)">Bren Adahan looked insufferably pleased with himself. "It's been years and years; Tommallo sold the inn long ago. I said I was the son of Vertum the hostler, and that I wanted the same suite of rooms that he rented, ten years ago; the owner shrugged to admit that there's nobody in the inn who was there ten years ago. So you get what you want, Walter Slovotsky," he said, turning to Walter. "You owe me one."</p>
<a id="p2476" name="p2476"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2476)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p2477" name="p2477"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2477)">The Inn of Quiet Repose wasn't as Walter had remembered it, either. Maybe it was that the colors in the tapestries had faded over the years; perhaps the food wasn't prepared with the same care that fat, jolly Tommallo had lavished. The meals were filling, but the beef was overdone and stringy; the beetle-paste was cloyingly sweet; the chotte tasted like it had been marinated in stale lard instead of fried in fresh butter.</p>
<a id="p2478" name="p2478"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2478)">The rug in their rooms was worn through in spots, and the chipped marble beneath was cold on his feet.</p>
<a id="p2479" name="p2479"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2479)">Well, it cost less than it had last time. And at least the bathwater was hot.</p>
<a id="p2480" name="p2480"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2480)">Toweling himself off, Walter walked into the common room, where Ahira and Tennetty were stretched out on the floor, talking while they worked on Tennetty's slave outfit. The ragged tunic drew attention to her long, skinny legs, drawing it away from the collar and manacles with their solid-appearing lock that she actually could remove in less than a second. The hasp of the padlock at her neck was actually the handle of a small Nehera-made knife; the body of the lock was its sheath.</p>
<a id="p2481" name="p2481"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2481)">"Where're the kids?"</p>
<a id="p2482" name="p2482"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2482)">Ahira jerked his head toward the door. "I sent them out to have a look around&#151;see what fast ships are docked, and where they're headed. We'll want something speedy, and planning a bit of a run&#151;say, at least as far as Lundesport."</p>
<a id="p2483" name="p2483"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2483)">"If we're going to ijack-hay it, it'll have to be something fairly small, too. We can't ride herd on a whole lot of crew."</p>
<a id="p2484" name="p2484"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2484)">"True. Get some sleep&#151;we've got a long day tomorrow."</p>
<a id="p2485" name="p2485"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2485)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p2486" name="p2486"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2486)">When they made love that night, it finally hit him, and not just as an intellectual proposition: Someday it would be over between the two of them. Not that night, but someday soon. After Melawei&#151;assuming that they could hire or hijack a ship and get to Melawei&#151;it would have to end.</p>
<a id="p2487" name="p2487"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2487)">Aeia's and his relationship was unnatural. You just couldn't go on having sex without consequences, not with someone you cared about.</p>
<a id="p2488" name="p2488"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2488)">Something would have to change.</p>
<a id="p2489" name="p2489"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2489)"><i>Idiot. </i>Something always changes.</p>
<a id="p2490" name="p2490"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2490)">He was homesick, he decided. Even with Aeia lying here, warm in his arms, he missed Kirah. Ridiculous. She didn't have Aeia's intellect or complexity, but there was something&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;comfortable, reliable about the old girl. Old girl, hah&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;she'd kept her looks. But she did have some funny ideas about Walter; she saw him as some sort of knight in shining armor, a kind of miniature Karl Cullinane.</p>
<a id="p2491" name="p2491"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2491)">Ridiculous.</p>
<a id="p2492" name="p2492"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2492)">Even more, he missed Janie. Damn, but she was a good kid.</p>
<a id="p2493" name="p2493"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2493)">She reminded him of himself; they were two of a kind, Walter and his elder daughter: totally without restraint, without conscience, substituting prudence, when necessary. Janie understood her father; she'd probably understand this.</p>
<a id="p2494" name="p2494"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2494)">It would be a shame for Janie and D.A. to grow up without a father.</p>
<a id="p2495" name="p2495"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2495)">Have to be some changes made, he decided. Not that Walter Slovotsky was going to be the faithful type, but it was time for some changes. Time to grow up a bit.</p>
<a id="p2496" name="p2496"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2496)">"Aeia&#160;.&#160;.&#160;." He stroked a hand down her smooth flank, then brought it up to cup her breast.</p>
<a id="p2497" name="p2497"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2497)">"Shh," she said. "I know." In the dark he could see her smile glisten. "But don't count on the timing. I might leave you before you leave me."</p>
<a id="p2498" name="p2498"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2498)">"Very funny."</p>
<a id="p2499" name="p2499"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2499)">"Isn't it, though?" There was a distant hint of hysterical laughter in her voice.</p>
<a id="p2500" name="p2500"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2500)">"So why are we both crying?"</p>
<a id="p2501" name="p2501"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2501)">She didn't answer. She just held him, her face wet against his chest, while he held her, his face wet against her hair.</p>
<a id="p2502" name="p2502"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2502)">&#160;</p>
