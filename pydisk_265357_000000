<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_22"></a><b>-4-</b></h1>
<a id="p2032" name="p2032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2032)">The priestess made no move, save to turn her head slightly toward the door, as if all her attention was given to what might be happening without. After what seemed only seconds, Tallahassee heard the voices of men, raised in anger, she believed. Now the priestess stepped forward beside Tallahassee, so they were ranged together facing the door.</p>
<a id="p2033" name="p2033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2033)">There came a sharp crack, enough to make Tallahassee start. She could not be sure, but that had sounded very much like a shot! Like the lighted block in the corner, the thought of modern weapons here was anachronistic. Fingers touched her arm. The priestess made a small gesture, one that urged Tallahassee to raise the rod before her. She remembered of old the common stance of most of the Egyptian statues, ankh, flail, crook so upheld.</p>
<a id="p2034" name="p2034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2034)">The other women backed into the room, their voices raised in hot protest. Herding them so came three men.</p>
<a id="p2035" name="p2035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2035)">Seeing them, the belief she had somehow returned to the ancient past vanished for Tallahassee. By rights these newcomers should have worn kilts, carried spears or bows. Instead, the newcomers were closer to her own world in their dress, for each wore a one-piece uniform, cut off at elbows and knees.</p>
<a id="p2036" name="p2036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2036)">The garment was a dull green in color, relieved only by a mask of Apedemek on the shoulder. Incongruously, their headgear, striped in two shades of green, did resemble the ancient sphinx headdress of the Egyptian fighting man. For the rest, they each carried what was manifestly a weapon, like and yet unlike, Tallahassee believed, the guns of her time. These were neither rifle nor handgun, but between those two in length. And the short barrels pointed along their own forearms, as they held them ready to fire.</p>
<a id="p2037" name="p2037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2037)">On catching sight of Tallahassee they halted&#151;their eyes went wide. Shock or mere surprise? She could not be sure. The priestess beside her broke into speech. Never had Tallahassee longed so much to know what was going on than at this moment.</p>
<a id="p2038" name="p2038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2038)">The two men behind the leader took a couple of steps backward, their discomfiture plain to read. What or who they had expected to find here, it was not those they fronted now. The priestess raised her ankh and spoke commandingly, while the leader of the trio scowled at her. A scar, which split his right cheek from temple to chin, did not add to any suggestion of mercy in his expression. He gave no ground, only glowered at the lioness-masked woman.</p>
<a id="p2039" name="p2039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2039)">The rod! Tallahassee decided to try a small experiment. She held the staff a little aslant so that its top crystal now inclined toward the man. He quickly shifted gaze from the priestess to the girl. She saw the change in his eyes.</p>
<a id="p2040" name="p2040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2040)">He was afraid! Afraid of either her or the rod, and she believed it the latter. Now an expression of sullen defeat warped his scarred features. Tallahassee took one step forward and then another. He retreated, but not as fast as his two followers, who broke and ran as the girl approached them.</p>
<a id="p2041" name="p2041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2041)">Their leader was not giving in easily. Tallahassee sensed danger building in this man. She had always been able somehow to pick up emotional reactions of others to herself, knowing when she was accepted, tolerated, or disliked. But it was no dislike this man radiated, rather it was hate. She was as certain of that as if he had shouted curses in her face.</p>
<a id="p2042" name="p2042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2042)">Driving him this way might be the worst move she could make. Yet the two women stepped quickly aside, and she was aware that the priestess walked steadily behind her. They <i>wanted </i>her to do just as she was doing!</p>
<a id="p2043" name="p2043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2043)">The soldier growled under his breath, a hostile mutter, yet he backed step by slow step, as she advanced. Now they passed into the outer chamber of the temple with the statue of Apedemek looming behind the man's shoulder. Back and back again&#151;outside into the white blare of the desert sun, the furnace heat.</p>
<a id="p2044" name="p2044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2044)">She caught a glimpse of something standing not too far away. But she could not look at it closely. It was necessary instead to keep her eyes on the man before her. Back still more until they were at the very edge of the temple pavement. Suddenly he swung his weapon by its strap up across his shoulder and spoke a last sharp sentence in which she could read menace without understanding the words.</p>
<a id="p2045" name="p2045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2045)">He seemed reluctant to turn his back on her. His withdrawal was rather crablike, glancing at her with a side look as he descended the wide outer steps and stalked away&#151;his whole body expressing his angry impotence&#151;to a flyer.</p>
<a id="p2046" name="p2046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2046)">To Tallahassee's eyes that vehicle possessed some of the attributes of a helicopter, save there were no whirling blades on top. Rather, once the man had made his way to the opening in its side and climbed within, it arose in a cloud of grit and sand by a method she did not understand.</p>
<a id="p2047" name="p2047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2047)">There had been an insignia painted on the flyer's side but those markings had no meaning for the girl. Again a touch on her wrist, and the priestess made that small inclination of her masked head, suggesting their return to the interior of the temple ruin. One of the women behind spoke and then spat outward in the direction of the vanished flyer. The roar of its withdrawal was already fading.</p>
<a id="p2048" name="p2048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2048)">The priestess wasted no more time. Instead she moved at a pace that closely approached a run, Tallahassee hurrying after, to reach the inner chamber. There the masked woman, once more on her knees before the lighted block, spoke to it with an imperative burst of words.</p>
<a id="p2049" name="p2049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2049)">Tallahassee moved closer to the woman who had spat after the retreating soldiers.</p>
<a id="p2050" name="p2050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2050)">"Who?" She tried to get into that word of her own language the sound of inquiry as she pointed to the outside.</p>
<a id="p2051" name="p2051"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2051)">For a moment it would seem that the woman was not going to answer, if indeed she understood Tallahassee's query. Then she spoke slowly and deliberately one word:</p>
<a id="p2052" name="p2052"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2052)">"Userkof." At least it sounded like that.</p>
<a id="p2053" name="p2053"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2053)">The part of Tallahassee's knowledge that had already found the small, disturbing, familiar hints in this place seized upon the sound. Userkof&#151;Nubian of the past&#151;or Egyptian? She was sure it was a man's name. But was it that of the leading intruder, or of one who had sent him? If she only <i>knew. </i>Her ignorance made her want to hurl the rod at the wall and then do a little therapeutic screaming. <i>When </i>would she ever find out what had happened, where she was, and why? The "why" might outweigh all the other points, she suspected.</p>
<a id="p2054" name="p2054"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2054)">They had made her up to play a part. Apparently, she was someone who, with the rod in hand, had authority to banish armed men who had certainly not come here for anything but trouble. And she had only a single name&#151;Userkof&#151;on which to build an answer.</p>
<a id="p2055" name="p2055"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2055)">Names? Names were important. Among some people the personal name held such great importance that they never revealed it to strangers, lest that give another some psychic hold over them. She could begin with names&#151;the first stumbling exchange in any language.</p>
<a id="p2056" name="p2056"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2056)">With her thumb she energetically thumped her own breast and asked again:</p>
<a id="p2057" name="p2057"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2057)">"Who?"</p>
<a id="p2058" name="p2058"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2058)">The woman glanced first at the priestess still busy crooning to the slab. This time her hesitation was even more marked. Yet she answered at last:</p>
<a id="p2059" name="p2059"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2059)">"Ashake."</p>
<a id="p2060" name="p2060"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2060)">"Ashake," Tallahassee repeated, striving to give the word the same pronunciation. Now she indicated the priestess:</p>
<a id="p2061" name="p2061"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2061)">"Who?"</p>
<a id="p2062" name="p2062"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2062)">"Jayta." This time the pause was not long. Perhaps the woman found that, since the sky had not fallen the first time, she dared be more helpful.</p>
<a id="p2063" name="p2063"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2063)">"Jayta." Now the girl's finger pointed to the woman. "Who?"</p>
<a id="p2064" name="p2064"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2064)">"Makeda."</p>
<a id="p2065" name="p2065"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2065)">The other woman was identified as Idia. Tallahassee was faintly encouraged. If they just cooperated a little she might be able to find out something.</p>
<a id="p2066" name="p2066"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2066)">"Where?" She moved her hand about in a gesture that she hoped would be intelligible to the other, who watched her very closely. But the three words she then got in answer meant nothing at all. And it was hard to be baffled again just when she had made progress, no matter how small.</p>
<a id="p2067" name="p2067"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2067)">The priestess arose from before the slab and uttered what could only be a string of orders. Both the other women hurried to draw together the pallets on the floor, pile them in a corner. They paid no attention to anything else but the basket from which they had taken the clothes Tallahassee now wore. That they carried out into the shadow of Apedemek's statue.</p>
<a id="p2068" name="p2068"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2068)">Jayta was busy with the slab, pressing her fingers carefully about the lowest of the three square blocks on which it was positioned. As if that had released some mounting, she picked it up and the light now vanished from its surface. An inclination of her head sent Tallahassee before her. It was plain they were making preparations to leave the temple. Leaving for where?</p>
<a id="p2069" name="p2069"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2069)">If she could only see more than just the priestess's eyes through the mask. One could learn much from an expression if one was attentive.</p>
<a id="p2070" name="p2070"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2070)">But she tried once more, waving her hand toward the outside and asking:</p>
<a id="p2071" name="p2071"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2071)">"Where?"</p>
<a id="p2072" name="p2072"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2072)">Again came more than one word, and those meant nothing at all. Yet Tallahassee believed that they were not the same Makeda had uttered earlier. Their destination? And how were they to travel?</p>
<a id="p2073" name="p2073"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2073)">That was answered soon enough by a second roar from the air. The invaders back with new forces? Tallahassee took a closer grip on the rod. A second party might not be so easily cowed.</p>
<a id="p2074" name="p2074"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2074)">Once more a flyer set down, spinning sand and grit in a murky cloud, wide enough to hide the whole entrance to the temple. As that settled, figures dropped from the machine, came trotting toward them. Uniforms again, but not the dull green of the first party. These were of a red shade, close to rust. And those wearing them were unmistakably women.</p>
<a id="p2075" name="p2075"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2075)">At the sight of Tallahassee, three of them dropped to their knees and raised one hand palm out, but with the other hand held ready the same type of weapon the men had borne. Their leader did not kneel, merely raised one hand to Tallahassee, and then broke into a spate of excited speech.</p>
<a id="p2076" name="p2076"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2076)">The priestess made a sharp answer, waved them on toward the waiting flyer. Tallahassee went with a faint reluctance. She had come into this world at this point. If she left here&#151;was there any way she could find her way back to her own place? For she was convinced now, in spite of herself, that this could not be a dream. And she had no reason to think she was hallucinating, unless the unknown radiation given off by the ankh had induced it.</p>
<a id="p2077" name="p2077"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2077)">Within the flyer, quarters were somewhat cramped. The priestess and Tallahassee were given a double seat while the temple women and the Amazons settled down on the flooring, drawing webbing belts over them. Tallahassee could see another uniformed woman at the controls. She was given little time to examine her surroundings before the flyer lifted with a jerk that made her feel unpleasantly like being caught in a runaway elevator.</p>
<a id="p2078" name="p2078"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2078)">She was not next to the small window, so could not catch any glimpse of the terrain over which they flew. But she had a sensation of speed which was surely greater than that of the helicopters of her own world.</p>
<a id="p2079" name="p2079"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2079)">This situation was like facing a giant puzzle, or rather two puzzles, where all pieces had been arbitrarily mixed so that one could make no sense out of either. The masked priestess, the ruins&#151;those she could better accept somehow than a flyer. She had seen the like of the former throughout the years of her study, if only in pictures. But what had ancient Egypt or Nubia to do with unfamiliar weapons and vehicles?</p>
<a id="p2080" name="p2080"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2080)">Her head ached under the weight of the wig they had forced on her. She longed to jerk it off, yet somehow knew that even so small an act of independence might bring serious consequences. The leader of the soldiers opened a small compartment set against the wall of the pilot's cubby and brought out a metal flask and some handleless cups. In spite of the unsteadiness of the flyer she poured a measure of liquid into a cup, about half-full, and handed it carefully to the priestess, who in turn, with a show of ceremony, held it out to Tallahassee.</p>
<a id="p2081" name="p2081"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2081)">She accepted with a murmur of thanks and drank. The contents were tart, and so cold that she had a momentary shock. She drank thirstily, realizing again that her body needed this though she had not been aware of that until she drank.</p>
<a id="p2082" name="p2082"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2082)">Another cup was offered to the priestess, but she declined. Tallahassee began to wonder how the woman could endure wearing the mask so continually, and why she did so. At the temple it might have been for some reasons of ceremony, but why did she cling to it now?</p>
<a id="p2083" name="p2083"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2083)">Then abruptly, they spiraled earthward, to set down with a slight jar. The Amazon officer made haste to open the door, scramble out, with her three followers, as if expecting some trouble against which they must guard. Jayta, if Jayta the priestess really was, touched Tallahassee gently on the arm and signed for her to go next.</p>
<a id="p2084" name="p2084"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2084)">She moved rather awkwardly, for though the priestess matched her in height as did the leader of the soldiers, the others were at least four or five inches shorter and the flyer had manifestly been designed to their norm instead of hers. As the girl came into the open down the single step, she was no longer in the desert. The sere stone and sand, the blank walls of the ruins were gone.</p>
<a id="p2085" name="p2085"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2085)">Here was a lush green that rested her eyes. A few feet away a path of stones set in colorful mosaic patterns led into a tunnel walled by palm trees and brilliantly flowered bushes. She sniffed the perfume of flowers, heavy, almost cloying to the senses, saw bits of what could only be a building of at least three stories engulfed by the lush greenery.</p>
<a id="p2086" name="p2086"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2086)">The Amazons stood at stiff attention, two on either side. As Tallahassee moved slowly and hesitantly down the walk, they fell in behind, leaving only the priestess a step or two to the rear as they went.</p>
<a id="p2087" name="p2087"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2087)">This was going it blind all right. She did not have the least idea of where she was heading, or what she was to do here. But it was a vast relief to get into the shadow of the palms and the tall branches of the bushes. There was a flash along the path toward her and Tallahassee froze, then gave a small laugh of embarrassment. For the newcomers were two kittens. Very superior kittens, since each had a gold ring in the right ear near the tip and wore in addition a collar with small tinkling bells.</p>
<a id="p2088" name="p2088"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2088)">The kittens halted, their baby heads up at an angle, watching her with that unblinking stare that cats use to make humans uneasy. If they were the dead girl's cats&#151;then the imposture Tallahassee had been ordered to.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;She stooped and held out her hand. All depended now on them. Suppose they unmasked her as a stranger, what would the Amazons behind her do? If Ashake were a princess, as the diadem on her stifling wig signified&#151;well, what might be the penalty for impersonating her? The larger of the kittens advanced hesitantly to sniff at Tallahassee's fingers. Sniffed a second time, then made a quick dab with a rough little tongue tip against her flesh.</p>
<a id="p2089" name="p2089"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2089)">The young cat uttered a sound which was not quite a mew and bounded at its companion. With a cuff of a paw it passed, streaking once more down the walk, its brother or sister now in wild pursuit.</p>
<a id="p2090" name="p2090"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2090)">Tallahassee gave a sigh of relief she hoped was not audible. She did not ask about her role, but she certainly wanted to be sure that she was not going to be unmasked at a time most dangerous to her.</p>
<a id="p2091" name="p2091"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2091)">Jayta spoke, addressing Tallahassee with deference she had not paid before. She gestured to the building only half seen among the thick growth, plainly urging the girl on.</p>
<a id="p2092" name="p2092"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2092)">They passed through a thicker growth which appeared to mark a hedge between a garden and the landing field. Now the building before them showed clearly above the carefully tended flower beds. Massive pillars flanked the front, supporting an overhang of the roof. And the pillars, like the ruins, were familiar. These were not the columns the western world had inherited from the Greeks. Rather they were designed to resemble thick stalks of flowers, formalized half-open buds forming their crowns.</p>
<a id="p2093" name="p2093"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2093)">The door they guarded was very wide, and gave, not on a hallway or room, but rather on an inner court, the center of which was occupied by a long pool in which living lotus plants fringed the sides. Guards by the door snapped to attention, Amazons again. Beyond, waited a group of white-clad women who scattered at an order from the priestess, though they went reluctantly, many looking at Tallahassee as if they expected her to countermand Jayta. A second order sent the two women who had come with them from the temple, to one side and ahead, carrying between them the dress basket.</p>
<a id="p2094" name="p2094"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2094)">As those two passed through one of the doors that lined the four sides of the inner court, Tallahassee caught the hint. Clever of Jayta&#151;she now knew just where she was to go and would make no betraying slip in choosing her room. As an embroidered door hanging fell behind her she looked curiously about these new quarters.</p>
<a id="p2095" name="p2095"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2095)">The walls were painted with a stylized pattern of lotus blossoms, bordering the head of a lioness which matched the mask her companion wore. Here was a narrow bed, the four legs of which had been inlaid to suggest a leopard's legs and paws. Folding tables stood beside two straight-backed, feline-footed chairs. And there was a padded bench before a more massive piece of furniture which consisted of two sets of drawers, an open space between, topped by a slab of inlaid wood on which stood a mirror, together with a number of small and fancifully carved and inlaid boxes and pots. As Tallahassee came a step or so farther into the chamber she caught full sight of herself in the mirror and gasped.</p>
<a id="p2096" name="p2096"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2096)">She faced a stranger. The thick makeup about her eyes&#151;the lines of which extended well back to the edge of the wig&#151;were almost as concealing as a mask. Her darker skin, the wig itself&#151;she might have walked out from some painted tomb wall in Thebes or Memphis!</p>
<a id="p2097" name="p2097"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2097)">"Ashake!" She was not aware she had said that name aloud until she heard herself.</p>
<a id="p2098" name="p2098"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2098)">It was hard to turn away from that stranger on the mirrored surface. She&#151;she was <i>not </i>Ashake. Suddenly her hands began to shake. She might even have dropped the rod had not a quick exclamation of warning made her look away from that deceiving reflection.</p>
<a id="p2099" name="p2099"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2099)">One of the temple women approached bearing a long case covered with gold, in raised design upon it those same spirit-protecting medallions she had pointed out on the box&#151;where, how long ago? The priestess pressed fingers at two places to lift the lid. Inside, a soft cushioning carried an impression, a hollow long and narrow, meant undoubtedly to contain the rod. Thankfully Tallahassee fitted that within and saw the box shut and laid upon the bed.</p>
<a id="p2100" name="p2100"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2100)">Then Jayta's hands went to the back of her own head, pressed at the nape of her neck much as she had on the case for the rod. A moment later the mask fell into two parts which one of the women took from her.</p>
<a id="p2101" name="p2101"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2101)">Tallahassee found herself facing a woman who had no claim to beauty. Her nose was a hawk's proud beak, her chin pointed and seeming (when seen in profile) to curve up to meet that same beak. The hair, close-cropped to her skull, was silvered, and she wore no makeup to enlarge her eyes or to give more color to her full lips. It was the face of one who had her orders obeyed and swiftly. Yet the strength in it, Tallahassee thought, was not marred by any touch of cruelty. Had she, in her own mind, ever built up an idea of justice personified, the answer could have come close to Jayta.</p>
<a id="p2102" name="p2102"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2102)">Now the priestess studied Tallahassee closely in turn, even as an artist might minutely examine some product of his hands, searching ruthlessly for the slightest fault. The other women retreated to the door, raised their hands in salute, and were gone. Tallahassee drew a deep breath and allowed herself to sit on one of the two chairs. Jayta continued to stand until Tallahassee, guessing at the cause, waved her companion to the other. Though this room was infinitely cooler than the ruined temple, she wanted to throw off the wig, rid herself of the grit that clung to her stained skin. Yet now she needed communication most.</p>
<a id="p2103" name="p2103"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2103)">There was a movement by the door and Idia slipped in again, almost furtively. She held a covered basket in her hands which she offered to Jayta. What the priestess lifted out was a box from which dangled two cords. Idia hurriedly pushed one of the tables closer and Jayta settled the box on that. She picked up one of the cords and inserted the hard tip of it in her ear, signaling for Tallahassee to do the same with the other.</p>
<a id="p2104" name="p2104"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2104)">The girl nearly jerked free again when she felt the result. Telepathy? No, for this exchange apparently needed the box. But she had indeed received a message&#151;not from lip to ear, but mind to mind.</p>
<a id="p2105" name="p2105"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2105)">"Do not fear, Lady."</p>
<a id="p2106" name="p2106"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2106)">Tallahassee half lifted her hand to pull out the cord, then forced her nerves under better control. This was what she wanted most: communication&#151;explanation.</p>
<a id="p2107" name="p2107"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2107)">"Who are you? Where am I? How did I get here?" She asked her questions in a quick whisper.</p>
<a id="p2108" name="p2108"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2108)">"Do not speak&#151;not until you know our tongue, Lady. There are far too many shadows who have ears and mouths to whisper in the wrong places what those ears have picked up. I am the Daughter-of-Apedemek, though many of our people have regretfully turned aside from the True Learning in these years. As to where you are&#151;that I cannot say more than this is the Empire of Amun in the two thousandth year since the parting of North and South. It is not your world. As to how you got here&#151;now that is a tale which must be made short for we have so little time. But it follows this pattern as a cub follows its dam.</p>
