<p>It was when the foundry imploded that Rees's curiosity about his world became unbearable.</p>

<p>The shift started normally enough with a thump on his cabin wall from the fist of Sheen, his shift supervisor. Groggily Rees pulled himself from his sleeping net and moved slowly about the jumbled cabin, grinding through his wake-up routines.</p>

<p>The water from the rusty spigot emerged reluctantly in the microgee conditions. The liquid was sour and cloudy. He forced down a few mouthfuls and splashed his face and hair. He wondered with a shudder how many human bodies this water had passed through since its first collection from a passing cloud; it had been dozens of shifts since the last supply tree from the Raft had called with fresh provisions, and the Belt's antique recycling system was showing its deficiencies.</p>

<p>He pulled on a stained, one-piece coverall. The garment was getting too short. At fifteen thousand shifts old he was dark, slim&mdash;and tall enough already and still growing, he thought gloomily. This observation made him think with a stab of sadness of his parents; it was just the sort of remark they might have made. His father, who had not long survived his mother, had died a few hundred shifts ago of circulatory problems and exhaustion. Suspended by one hand from the door frame Rees surveyed the little iron-walled cabin, recalling how cluttered it had seemed when he'd shared it with his parents.</p>

<p>He pushed such thoughts away and wriggled through the narrow door frame.</p>

<p>He blinked for a few seconds, dazzled by the shifting starlight... and hesitated. There was a faint scent on the air. A richness, like meat-sim. Something burning?</p>

<p>His cabin was connected to his neighbor's by a few yards of fraying rope and by lengths of rusty piping; he pulled himself a few feet along the rope and hung there, eyes raking the world around him for the source of the jarring scent.</p>

<p>The air of the Nebula was, as always, stained blood-red. A corner of his mind tried to measure that redness&mdash;was it deeper than last shift?&mdash;while his eyes flicked around the objects scattered through the Nebula above and below him. The clouds were like handfuls of grayish cloth sprinkled through miles of air. Stars fell among and through the clouds in a slow, endless rain that tumbled down to the Core. The light of the mile-wide spheres cast shifting shadows over the clouds, the scattered trees, the huge blurs that might be whales. Here and there he saw a tiny flash that marked the end of a star's brief existence.</p>

<p>How many stars were there?</p>

<p>As a child Rees had hovered among the cables, eyes wide, counting up to the limits of his knowledge and patience. Now he suspected that the stars were without number, that there were more stars than hairs on his head... or thoughts in his head, or words on his tongue. He raised his head and scoured a sky that was filled with stars. It was as if he were suspended in a great cloud of light; the star-spheres receded with distance into points of light, so that the sky itself was a curtain glowing red-yellow.</p>

<p>The burning scent called to him again, seeping through the thin air. He wrapped his toes in the cabin cable and released his hands; he let the spin of the Belt straighten his spine, and from this new viewpoint surveyed his home.</p>

<p>The Belt was a circle about eight hundred yards wide, a chain of battered dwellings and work places connected by ropes and tubes. At the center of the Belt was the mine itself, a cooled-down star kernel a hundred yards wide; lifting cables dangled from the Belt to the surface of the star kernel, scraping the rusty meniscus at a few feet per second.</p>

<p>Here and there, fixed to the walls and roofs of the Belt, were the massive, white-metal mouths of jets; every few minutes a puff of steam emerged from one of those throats and the Belt tugged imperceptibly faster at his heels, shaking off the slowing effects of air friction. He studied the ragged rim of the nearest jet; it was fixed to his neighbor's roof and showed signs of hasty cutting and welding. As usual his attention drifted off into random speculation. What vessel, or other device, had that jet come from? Who were the men who had cut it away? And why had they come here...?</p>

<p>Again the whiff of fire. He shook his head, trying to concentrate.</p>

<p>It was shift-change time, of course, and there were little knots of activity around most of the cabins in the Belt as workers, grimy and tired, made for their sleep nets&mdash;and, a quarter of the Belt's circumference from him, a haze of smoke hovered around the foundry. He saw men dive again and again into the grayish fog. When they reemerged they tugged limp, blackened forms.</p>

<p>Bodies?</p>

<p>With a soft cry he curled, grasped the rope and sprint-crawled over the diffuse gravity wells of cabin roofs and walls to the foundry.</p>

<p>He hesitated on the edge of the sphere of smoke. The stench of burnt meat-sim made his empty stomach twist. Two figures emerged from the haze, solidifying like figures in a dream. They carried an unrecognizable, bloodied bundle between them. Rees anchored himself and reached down to help them; he tried not to recoil as charred flesh peeled away in his hands.</p>

<p>The limp form was bundled in stained blankets and hauled tenderly away. One of the two rescuers straightened before Rees; white eyes shone out of a soot-smeared face. It took him a few seconds to recognize Sheen, his shift supervisor. The pull of her hot, blackened body was a distant tugging at his belly, and he was ashamed to find, even at a moment like this, his eyes tracking sweat droplets over her blood-smeared chest. "You're late," she said, her voice smoke-deep as a man's.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. What's happened?"</p>

<p>"An implosion. What do you think?" Pushing scorched hair from her brow she turned and pointed into the stationary pall of smoke. Now Rees could make out the shape of the foundry within; its cubical form had buckled, as if crushed by a giant hand. "Two dead so far," Sheen said. "Damn it. That's the third collapse in the last hundred shifts. If only Gord built strong enough for this damn stupid universe, I wouldn't have to scrape my workmates off each other like so much spoiled meat-sim. Damn, damn."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him with annoyance; he felt a flush of embarrassment and fear climb in his cheeks. Her irritation seemed to soften a little. "Help us haul the rest out. Stick close to me and you'll be fine. Try to breathe through your nose, OK?"</p>

<p>And she turned and dived back into the spreading smoke. Rees hesitated for a single second, then hurried after her.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>The bodies were cleared and allowed to drift away into the Nebula air, while the injured were collected by their families and gently bundled to waiting cabins. The fire in the foundry was doused and soon the smoke was dispersing. Gord, the Belt's chief engineer, crawled over the ruins. The engineer was a short, blond man; he shook his head miserably as he began the work of planning the rebuilding of the foundry. Rees saw how the relatives of the dead and injured regarded Gord with hatred as he went about his work. Surely the series of implosions could not be blamed on the engineer?</p>

<p>...But if not Gord, who?</p>

<p>Rees's shift was cancelled. The Belt had a second foundry, separated from the ruin by a hundred and eighty degrees, and Rees would be expected to call there on his next working shift; but for now he was free.</p>

<p>He pulled his way slowly back to his cabin, staring with fascination at the blood-trails left by his hands on ropes and roofs. His head seemed still to be full of smoke. He paused for a few minutes at the entrance to his cabin, trying to suck clean oxygen from the air; but the ruddy, shifting starlight seemed almost as thick as smoke. Sometimes the Nebula breezes seemed almost unbreathable.</p>

<p>If only the sky were blue, he thought vaguely. I wonder what blue is like... Even in his parents' childhood&mdash;so his father had said&mdash;there were still hints of blue in the sky, off at the edges of the Nebula, far beyond the clouds and stars. He closed his eyes, trying to picture a color he had never seen, thinking of coolness, of clear water.</p>

<p>So the world had changed since his father's day. Why? And would it change again? Would blue and those other cool colors return&mdash;or would the redness deepen until it was the color of ruined flesh&mdash;</p>

<p>Rees pulled his way into his cabin and ran the spigot. He took off his tunic and scrubbed at his bloodstained skin until it ached.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p><i>The flesh peeled from the body in his hands like the skin from rotten fruit-sim; bone gleamed white</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>He lay in his net, eyes wide, remembering.</p>

<p>A distant handbell rang three times. So it was still only mid-shift&mdash;he had to endure another shift and a half, a full twelve hours, before he had an excuse to leave the cabin.</p>

<p>If he stayed here he'd go crazy.</p>

<p>He rolled out of his net, pulled on his coverall and slid out of the cabin. The quickest way to the Quartermaster's was along the Belt past the wrecked foundry; deliberately he turned and crawled the other way.</p>

<p>People nodded from windows and outdoor nets as he passed, some smiling with faint sympathy. There were only a couple of hundred people in the Belt; the tragedy must have hit almost everybody. From dozens of cabins came the sounds of soft weeping, of cries of pain.</p>

<p>Rees lived alone, keeping mostly to his own company; but he knew almost everybody in the Belt. Now he lingered by cabins where people to whom he was a little closer must be suffering, perhaps dying; but he hurried on, feeling isolation thicken around him like smoke.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster's bar was one of the Belt's largest buildings at twenty yards across; it was laced with climbing ropes, and bar stock covered most of one wall. This shift the place was crowded: the stink of alcohol and weed, the bellow of voices, the pull of a mass of hot bodies&mdash;it all hit Rees as if he'd run into a wall. Jame, the barman, plied his trade briskly, laughing raucously through a graying tangle of beard. Rees lingered on the fringe of the milling crowd, anxious not to return to his desolate cabin; but the drink and laughter seemed to flow around him, excluding him, and he turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Rees! Wait..."</p>

<p>It was Sheen. She had pushed away from the center of a group of men; one of them&mdash;a huge, intimidating miner called Roch&mdash;called after her drunkenly. Sheen's cheeks were moist from the heat of the bar and she had cropped away her scorched hair; otherwise she was bright and clean in a fresh, skimpy tunic. When she spoke her voice was still scoured rough by the smoke. "I saw you come in. Here. You look like you need this." She held out a drink in a tarnished globe.</p>

<p>Suddenly awkward, Rees said, "I was going to leave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you were." She moved closer to him, unsmiling, and pushed the drink into his chest. "Take it anyway." Again he felt the pull of her body as a warmth in his stomachs&mdash;why should her gravity field have such a distinct flavor from that of others?&mdash;and he was distractingly aware of her bare arms.</p>

<p>"Thanks." He took the drink and sucked at the globe's plastic nipple; hot liquor coursed over his tongue. "Maybe I did need that."</p>

<p>Sheen studied him with frank curiosity. "You're an odd one, Rees, aren't you?"</p>

<p>He stared back, letting his eyes slide over the smoothness of the skin around her eyes. It struck him that she wasn't really much older than he was. "How am I odd?"</p>

<p>"You keep yourself to yourself."</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>"Look, it's something you need to grow out of. You need company. We all do. Especially after a shift like this one."</p>

<p>"What did you mean earlier?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"During the implosion. You said how hard it was to build anything strong enough for this universe."</p>

<p>"What about it?"</p>

<p>"Well... what other universe is there?"</p>

<p>She sucked at her drink, ignoring the shouted invitations from the party behind her. "Who cares?"</p>

<p>"My father used to say the mine was killing us all. Humans weren't meant to work down there, crawling around in wheelchairs at five gee."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Rees, you're a character. But I'm not in the mood for metaphysical speculation, frankly. What I'm in the mood for is to get brain-dead on this fermented fruit-sim. So you can join me and the boys if you want, or you can go and sigh at the stars. OK?" She floated away, looking back questioningly; he shook his head, smiling stiffly, and she drifted back to her party, disappearing into a little pool of arms and legs.</p>

<p>Rees finished his drink, struggled to the bar to return the empty globe, and left.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>A heavy cloud, fat with rain, drifted over the Belt, reducing visibility to a few yards; the air it brought with it seemed exceptionally sour and thin.</p>

<p>Rees prowled around the cables that girdled his world, muscles working restlessly. He completed two full circuits, passing huts and cabins familiar since his childhood, hurrying past well-known faces. The damp cloud, the thin air, the confinement of the Belt seemed to come together somewhere inside his chest. Questions chased around his skull. Why were human materials and building methods so inadequate to resist the forces of the world? Why were human bodies so feeble in the face of those forces?</p>

<p>Why had his parents had to die, without answering the questions that had haunted him since childhood?</p>

<p>Shards of rationality glittered in the mud of his overtired thinking. His parents had had no better understanding of their circumstances than he had; there had been nothing but legends they could tell him before their sour deaths. Children's tales of a Ship, a Crew, of something called Bolder's Ring... But his parents had had&mdash;acceptance. They, and the rest of the Belt dwellers&mdash;even the sparkiest, like Sheen&mdash;seemed implicitly to accept their lot. Only Rees seemed plagued by questions, unanswered doubts.</p>

<p>Why couldn't he be like everyone else? Why couldn't he just accept and be accepted?</p>

<p>He let himself drift to rest, arms aching, cloud mist spattering his face. In all his universe there was only one entity which he could talk to about this&mdash;which would respond in any meaningful way to his questions.</p>

<p>And that was a digging machine.</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse he looked about. He was perhaps a hundred yards from the nearest mine elevator station; his arms and legs carried him to it with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Cloud mist swirled after Rees as he entered the station. The place was deserted, as Rees had expected. The whole shift would be lost to mourning; not for another two or three hours would the bleary-eyed workers of the next shift begin to arrive.</p>

<p>The station was little more than another cubical iron shack, locked into the Belt. It was dominated by a massive drum around which a fine cable was coiled. The drum was framed by winch equipment constructed of some metal that remained free of rust, and from the cable dangled a heavy chair fitted with large, fat wheels. The chair was topped by a head and neck support and was thickly padded. There was a control panel fixed to a strut at one end of the drum; the panel was an arm's-length square and contained fist-sized, color-coded switches and dials. Rees rapidly set up a descent sequence on the panel and the winch drum began to vibrate.</p>

<p>He slid into the chair, taking care to smooth the clothing under his back and legs. On the surface of the star a crease of cloth could cut like a knife. A red light flashed on the control panel, casting sombre shadows, and the base of the cabin slid aside with a soft grind. The ancient machinery worked with a chorus of scrapes and squeaks; the drum turned and the cable began to pay out.</p>

<p>With a jolt Rees dropped through the station floor and into the dense cloud. The chair was pulled down the guide cable; the guide continued through the mist, he knew, for four hundred yards to the surface of the star. The familiar sensation of shifting gravity pulled at his stomach like gentle hands. The Belt was rotating a little faster than its orbital velocity&mdash;to keep the chain of cabins taut&mdash;and a few yards below the Belt the centripetal force faded, so that Rees drifted briefly through true weightlessness. Then he entered the gravity well of the star kernel and his weight built up rapidly, plating over his chest and stomach like iron.</p>

<p>Despite the mounting discomfort he felt a sense of release. He wondered what his workmates would think if they could see him now. To choose to descend to the mine during an off-shift... and what for? To talk to a digging machine?</p>

<p>The oval face of Sheen floated before him, intelligent, skeptical and pragmatic.</p>

<p>He felt a flush burn up through his cheeks and he was suddenly glad that his descent was hidden by the mist.</p>

<p>He dropped out of the mist and the star kernel was revealed. It was a porous ball of iron fifty yards wide, visibly scarred by the hands and the machines of men. The guide cable&mdash;and its siblings, spread evenly around the Belt&mdash;scraped along the iron equator at a speed of a few feet each second.</p>

<p>His descent slowed; he imagined the winch four hundred yards above him straining to hold him against the star's clutching pull. Weight built up more rapidly now, climbing to its chest-crushing peak of five gees. The wheels of the chair began to rotate, whirring; then, cautiously, they kissed the moving iron surface. There was a bump which knocked the breath out of him. The cable disengaged rapidly, whipping backwards and away through the mist. The chair rolled slowly to a halt, carrying Rees a few yards from the trail of the cable.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Rees sat in the silence of the deserted star, allowing his breathing to adjust.

flying through the air at will, independent of gravity. How paradoxical, Rees thought, that the billion-gee environment of this universe should afford humans such freedom.</p>

<p>Now the dancers launched into a final, elaborate arc, their bodies orbiting, their faces locked together like facing planets. Then it was over; the dancers stood hand-in-hand atop their trampoline, and Rees cheered and stamped with the rest. So there was more to do with billion-strength gravity than measure it and fight it&mdash;</p>

<p>A flash, a muffled rush of air, a sudden blossom of smoke. The trampoline, blasted from below, turned briefly into a fluttering, birdlike creature, a dancer itself; the dancers, screaming, were hurled into the air. Then the trampoline collapsed into the splintered ruins of the stage, the dancers falling after it.</p>

<p>The audience, stunned, fell silent. The only sound was a low, broken crying from the wreckage of the stage, and Rees watched, unbelieving, as a red-brown stain spread over the remains of the trampoline.</p>

<p>A burly man bearing orange braids hurried from the wings and stood commandingly before the audience. "Sit down," he ordered. "No one should try to leave." And he stood there as the audience quietly obeyed. Rees, looking around, saw more orange braids at the exits from the Theatre, still more working their way into the ruins of the stage.</p>

<p>Baert's face was pale. "Security," he whispered. "Report directly to the Captain. You don't see them around too often, but they're always there... undercover as often as not." He sat back and folded his arms. "What a mess. They'll interrogate us all before they let us out of here; it will take hours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baert, I don't understand any of this. What happened?"</p>

<p>Baert shrugged. "What do you think? A bomb, of course."</p>

<p>Rees felt an echo of the disorientation he had suffered when the drinks girl had walked by. "Someone did this deliberately?"</p>

<p>Baert looked at him sourly and did not reply.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't speak for those people." Baert rubbed the side of his nose. "But there's been a few of these attacks, directed against Officers, mostly, or places they're likely to be. Like this.</p>

<p>"Not everyone's happy here, you see, my friend," he went on. "A lot of people think the Officers get more than their share."</p>

<p>"So they're turning to actions like this?" Rees turned away. The red-stained trampoline was being wrapped around the limp bodies of the gravity dancers; he watched with an unshakeable sense of unreality. He remembered his own flash of resentment at Baert, not more than an hour before this disaster. Perhaps he could sympathize with the motives of the people behind this act&mdash;why should one group enjoy at leisure the fruits of another's labor?&mdash;but to kill for such a reason?</p>

<p>The orange-braided security men began to organize strip searches of the crowd. Resigned, not speaking, Rees and Baert sat back to wait their turn.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>Despite isolated incidents like the Theatre attack Rees found his new life fascinating and rewarding, and the shifts wore away unbelievably quickly. All too soon, it seemed, he had finished his Thousand Shifts, the first stage of his graduation process, and it was time for his achievement to be honored.</p>

<p>And so he found himself sitting on a decorated bus and studying the crimson braids of a Scientist (Third Class), freshly stitched to the shoulder of his coverall, and shivering with a sense of unreality. The bus worked its way through the suburbs of the Raft. Its dozen young occupants, Rees's fellow graduate-apprentices, spun out a cloud of laughter and talk.</p>

<p>Jaen was studying him with humorous concern, a slight crease over her broad nose; her hands rested in the lap of her dress uniform. "Something on your mind?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I'm fine. You know me. I'm the serious type."</p>

<p>"Damn right. Here." Jaen reached to the boy sitting on the far side from Rees and took a narrow-necked bottle. "Drink. You're graduating. This is your Thousandth Shift and you're entitled to enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't precisely. I was a slow starter, remember. For me it's more like a thousand and a quarter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you boring bugger, drink some of this stuff before I kick you off the bus."</p>

<p>Rees, laughing, gave in and took a deep draught from the bottle.</p>

<p>He had sampled some tough liquors in the Quartermaster's bar, and plenty of them had been stronger than this fizzing wine-sim; but none of them had quite the same effect. Soon the globe lights lining the avenue of cables seemed to emit a more friendly light; Jaen's gravity pull mingling with his was a source of warmth and stillness; and the brittle conversation of his companions seemed to grow vivid and amusing.</p>

<p>His mood persisted as they emerged from beneath the canopy of flying trees and reached the shadow of the Platform. The great lip of metal jutted inwards from the Rim, forming a black rectangle cut out of the crimson of the sky, its supporting braces like gaunt limbs. The bus wheezed to a halt alongside a set of wide stairs. Rees, Jaen and the rest tumbled from the bus and clambered up the stairs to the Platform.</p>

<p>The Thousandth Shift party was already in full swing, bustling with perhaps a hundred graduates of the various Classes of the Raft. A bar set up on trestle tables was doing healthy business, and a discordant set of musicians was thumping out a rhythmic sound&mdash;there were even a few couples tentatively dancing, near the band's low stage. Rees, with Jaen in tolerant tow, set off on a tour of the walls of the Platform.</p>

<p>The Platform was an elegant idea: to fix a hundred-yard-square plate to the Rim at such an angle that it matched the local horizontal, surround it by a wall of glass, and so reveal a universe of spectacular views. At the inward edge was the Raft itself, tilted like some huge toy for Rees's inspection. As at the Theatre the sensation of being on a safe, flat surface gave the proximity of the vast slope a vertiginous thrill.</p>

<p>The space-facing edge of the platform was suspended over the Rim of the Raft, and a section of the floor was inset with sheets of glass. Rees stood over the depths of the Nebula; it felt as if he were floating in the air. He could see hundreds of stars scattered in a vast three-dimensional array, illuminating the air like mile-wide globe lamps; and at the center of the view, towards the hidden Core of the Nebula, the stars were crowded together, so that it was as if he were staring into a vast, star-walled shaft.</p>

<p>"Rees. I congratulate you." Rees turned. Hollerbach, gaunt, unsmiling and utterly out of place in all this gaiety, stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The old Scientist leaned towards him conspiratorially. "Of course, I didn't doubt you'd do well from the first."</p>

<p>Rees laughed. "I can tell you I doubted it sometimes."</p>

<p>"A Thousand Shifts, eh?" Hollerbach scratched his cheek. "Well, I've no doubt you'll go much further... And in the meantime here's something for you to think about, boy. The ancients, the first Crew, didn't measure time exclusively in shifts. We know this from their records. They used shifts, yes, but they had other units: a 'day,' which was about three shifts, and a 'year,' which was about a thousand shifts. How old are you now?"</p>

<p>"About seventeen thousand, I believe, sir."</p>

<p>"So you'd be about seventeen 'years' old, eh? Now then&mdash;what do you suppose these units, a 'day' and a 'year,' referred to?" But before Rees could answer Hollerbach raised his hand and walked off. "Baert! So they've let you get this far despite my efforts to the contrary&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bowls of sweetmeats had been set out around the walls. Jaen nibbled on some fluffy substance and tugged absently at his hand. "Come on. Isn't that enough sightseeing and science?"</p>

<p>Rees looked at her, the combination of wine-sim and stars leaving him quite dazed. "Hm? You know, Jaen, the stories of our home universe notwithstanding, sometimes this seems a very beautiful place." He grinned. "And you don't look too bad yourself."</p>

<p>She punched him in the solar plexus. "And nor do you. Now let's have a dance."</p>

<p>"What?" His euphoria evaporated. He looked past her shoulder at the whirl of dancing couples. "Look, Jaen, I've never danced in my life."</p>

<p>She clicked her tongue. "Don't be such a coward, you mine rat. Those people are just ex-apprentices like you and me, and I can tell you one thing for sure: they won't be watching you."</p>

<p>"Well..." he began, but it was too late; with a determined grip on his forearm she led him to the center of the Platform.</p>

<p>His head filled with memories of the unfortunate gravity dancers at the Theatre of Light and their swooping, spectacular ballet. If he lived for fifty thousand shifts he would never be able to match such grace.</p>

<p>Luckily this dance was nothing like that.</p>

<p>Young men eyed girls across a few yards of floor. Those who were dancing were enthusiastic but hardly expert; Rees watched for a few seconds, then began to imitate their rhythmic swaying.</p>

<p>Jaen pulled a face at him. "That's bloody awful. But who cares?"</p>

<p>In the low-gee conditions&mdash;gravity here was about half its value near the Labs&mdash;the dance had a dreamy slowness. After a while Rees began to relax; and, eventually, he realized he was enjoying himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;until his legs whisked out from under him; he clattered to the Platform with a slow bump. Jaen covered her face with one hand, suppressing giggles; a circle of laughter clustered briefly around him. He got to his feet. "I'm sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a tap on his shoulder. "So you should be."</p>

<p>He turned; there, with a broad, glinting grin, stood a tall young man with the braids of a Junior Officer. "Doav," Rees said slowly. "Did you trip me?"</p>

<p>Doav barked laughter.</p>

<p>Rees felt his forearm muscles bunch. "Doav, you've been an irritation to me for the last year..."</p>

<p>Doav looked baffled.</p>

<p>"...I mean, the last thousand shifts." And it was true; Rees could bear the constant sniping, cracks and cruelties of Doav and his like throughout his working day... but he would much prefer not to have to. And, since the incident at the Theatre, he had come to see how attitudes like Doav's were the cause of a great deal of pain and suffering on the Raft; and, perhaps, of much more to come.</p>

<p>The wine-sim was like blood now, pounding in his head. "Cadet, if we've something to settle&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doav fixed him with a look of contempt. "Not here. But soon. Oh, yes; soon." And he turned his back and walked off through the throng.</p>

<p>Jaen thumped Rees's arm hard enough to make him flinch. "Do you have to turn every incident into an exhibition? Come on; let's get a drink." She stamped her way towards the bar.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rees."</p>

<p>Rees paused, allowing Jaen to slip ahead into the crush around the bar. A thin young man stood before him, hair plastered across his scalp. He wore the black braids of Infrastructure and he regarded Rees with cool appraisal.</p>

<p>Rees groaned. "Gover. I guess this isn't to be the best shift I've ever had."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I haven't seen you since not long after my arrival."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but that's not hard to understand." Gover flicked delicately at Rees's braid. "We move in different circles, don't we?"</p>

<p>Rees, already on edge after the incident with Doav, studied Gover as coolly as he could. There were still the same sharp features, the look of petulant anger&mdash;but Gover looked more substantial, more sure of himself.</p>

<p>"So you're still skivvying for those old farts in the Labs, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to respond to that, Gover."</p>

<p>"You're not?" Gover rubbed at his nostrils with the palm of his hand. "Seeing you in this toy uniform made me wonder how you see yourself now. I bet you haven't done a shift's work&mdash;real work&mdash;since you landed here. I wonder what your fellow rats would think of you now. Eh?"</p>

<p>Rees felt blood surge once more to his cheeks; the wine-sim seemed to be turning sour. There was a seed of confusion inside him. Was his anger at Gover just a way of shielding himself from the truth, that he had betrayed his origins...?</p>

<p>"What do you want, Gover?"</p>

<p>Gover took a step closer to Rees. His stale breath cut through the wine fumes in Rees's nostrils. "Listen, mine rat, believe it or not I want to do you a favor."</p>

<p>"What kind of favor?"</p>

<p>"Things are changing here," Gover said slyly. "Do you understand what I'm saying? Things won't always be as they are now." He eyed Rees, evidently unwilling to go further.</p>

<p>Rees frowned. "What are you talking about? The discontents?"</p>

<p>"That's what some call them. Seekers of justice, others say."</p>

<p>The noise of the revelers seemed to recede from Rees; it was as if Gover and he shared their own Raft somewhere in the air. "Gover, I was in the Theatre of Light, that shift. Was that justice?"</p>

<p>Gover's eyes narrowed. "Rees, you've seen how the elite on this Raft keep the rest of us down&mdash;and how their obscene economic system degrades the rest of the Nebula's human population. The time is near when they will have to atone."</p>

<p>Rees stared at him. "You're one of them, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Gover bit his lip. "Maybe. Look, Rees, I'm taking a chance talking to you like this. And if you betray me I'll deny we ever had this conversation."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"There are good men in the cause. Men like Decker, Pallis&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rees guffawed. Decker&mdash;the huge Infrastructure worker he had encountered on his first arrival here&mdash;he could believe. But Pallis? "Come on, Gover."</p>

<p>Gover was unruffled. "Damn it, Rees, you know what I think of you. You're a mine rat. You don't belong here, among decent people. But where you come from makes you one of us. All I'm asking is that you come along and listen to what they have to say. With your access to the Science buildings you could be... useful."</p>

<p>Rees tried to clear his thinking. Gover was a vicious, bitter young man, and his arguments&mdash;the contradictory mixture of contempt and appeal to fellow-feeling he directed at Rees, for example&mdash;were simple-minded and muddled. But what gave Gover's words force was their terrible truth. Part of Rees was appalled that such as Gover could so quickly disorient him&mdash;but inside him a core of anger flared up in response.</p>

<p>But if some revolution were to occur&mdash;if the Labs were smashed, the Officers imprisoned&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>"Gover, look up."</p>

<p>Gover raised his face.</p>

<p>"See that star up there? If we don't move the Raft the star will graze us. And then we'll fry. And even if we were to survive that&mdash;look further out." He swept an arm around the red-stained sky. "The Nebula's dying and we'll die with it. Gover, only the Scientists, backed by the organization of the Raft, can save us from such dangers."</p>

<p>Gover scowled and spat at the deck. "You seriously believe that? Come on, Rees. I'll tell you something. The Nebula could support us all for a long time yet&mdash;if its resources were shared equally. And that's all we want." He paused. "Well?"</p>

<p>Rees closed his eyes. Would sky wolves discuss Gover's case as they descended on the wreck of the Raft and picked clean the bones of his children? "Get lost, Gover," he said tiredly.</p>

<p>Gover sneered. "If that's what you want. I can't say I'm sorry..." He grinned at Rees with something approaching pure contempt. Then he slid away through the crowd.</p>

<p>The noise seemed to swirl around Rees, not touching him. He pushed his way through the crush to the bar and ordered straight liquor, and downed the hot liquid in one throw.</p>

<p>Jaen joined him and grabbed his arm. "I've been looking for you. Where...?" Then she felt the bunched muscles under Rees's jacket; and when he turned to face her, she shrank back from his anger.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">6</h3>

<p>The Scientist Second Class stood in the doorway of the Bridge. He watched the new Third Class approach and tried to hide a smile. The young man's uniform was so obviously new, he stared with such awe at the Bridge's silver hull, and his pallor was undisputable evidence of his Thousandth Shift celebration, which had finished probably mere hours earlier... The Second Class felt quite old as he remembered his own Thousandth Shift, his own arrival at the Bridge, a good three thousand shifts ago.</p>

<p>At least this boy had a look of inquiry about him. So many of the apprentices the Second had to deal with were sullen and resentful at best, downright contemptuous at worst; and the rates of absenteeism and dismissal were worsening. He reached out a hand as the young man approached.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Bridge," said Scientist Second Class Rees.</p>

<p>The boy&mdash;blond, with a premature streak of gray&mdash;was called Nead. He smiled uncertainly.</p>

<p>A bulky, grim-faced security guard stood just inside the door. He fixed Nead with a threatening stare; Rees saw how the boy quailed. Rees sighed. "It's all right, lad; this is just old Forv; it's his job to remember your face, that's all." It was only recently, Rees realized a little wistfully, that such heavy-handed security measures had come to seem necessary; with the continuing decline in food supplies, the mood on the Raft had worsened, and the severity and frequency of the attacks of the "discontents" were increasing. Sometimes Rees wondered if&mdash;</p>

<p>He shook his head to dismiss such thoughts; he had a job to do. He walked the wide-eyed boy slowly through the Bridge's gleaming corridors. "It's enough for now if you get an idea of the layout of the place," he said. "The Bridge is a cylinder a hundred yards long. This corridor runs around its midriff. The interior is divided into three rooms&mdash;a large middle chamber and two smaller chambers toward the ends. We think that the latter were once control rooms, perhaps equipment lockers; you see, the Bridge seems to have been a part of the original Ship..."</p>

<p>They had reached one of the smaller chambers; it was stacked with books, piles of paper and devices of all shapes and sizes. Two Scientists, bent in concentration, sat cocooned in dust. Nead turned flat, brown eyes on Rees. "What's this room used for now?"</p>

<p>"This is the Library," Rees said quietly. "The Bridge is the most secure place we have, the best protected from weather, accident&mdash;so we keep our records here. As much as we can: one copy of everything vital, and some of the stranger artefacts that have come down to us from the past..."</p>

<p>They walked on following the corridor to a shallow staircase set into the floor. They began to descend toward a door set in the inner wall, which led to the Bridge's central chamber. Rees thought of warning the boy to watch his step&mdash;then decided against it, a slightly malicious humor sparkling within him.</p>

<p>Nead took three or four steps down&mdash;then, arms flailing, he tipped face-forward. He didn't fall; instead he bobbed in the stairwell, turning a slow somersault. It was as if he had fallen into some invisible fluid.</p>

<p>Rees grinned broadly.</p>

<p>Nead, panting, reached for the wall. His palms flat against the metal he steadied himself and scrambled back up the steps. "By the Bones," he swore, "what's down there?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, it's harmless," Rees said. "It caught me the first time too. Nead, you're a Scientist now. Think about it. What happened when you went down those steps?"</p>

<p>The boy looked blank.</p>

<p>Rees sighed. "You passed through the plane of the Raft's deck, didn't you? It's the metal of the deck that provides the Raft's gravity pull. So here&mdash;at the center of the Raft, and actually in its plane&mdash;there is no pull. You see? You walked into a weightless zone."</p>

<p>Nead opened his mouth&mdash;then closed it again, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it," Rees snapped. "And maybe, with time, you'll even understand it. Come on."</p>

<p>He led the way through the doorway to the central chamber, and was gratified to hear Nead gasp.</p>

<p>They had entered an airy room some fifty yards wide. Most of its floor area was transparent, a single vast window which afforded a vertiginous view of the depths of the Nebula. Gaunt machines taller than men were fixed around the window. To Nead's untutored eye, Rees reflected, the machines must look like huge, unlikely insects, studded with lenses and antennae and peering into some deep pool of air. The room was filled with a clean smell of ozone and lubricating oil; servomotors hummed softly.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen Scientists working this shift; they moved about the machines making adjustments and jotting copious notes. And because the plane of the Raft passed over the window-floor at about waist height, the Scientists bobbed in the air like boats in an invisible pond, their centers of gravity oscillating above and below the equilibrium line with periods of two or three seconds. Rees, looking at the scene as if through new eyes, found himself hiding another grin. One small, round man had even, quite unselfconsciously, turned upside down to bring his eyes closer to a sensor panel. His trousers rode continually toward the equilibrium plane, so that his short legs protruded, bare.</p>

<p>They stood on a low ledge; Rees took a step down and was soon floating in the air, his feet a few inches from the window-floor. Nead lingered nervously. "Come on, it's easy," Rees said. "Just swim in the air, or bounce up and down until your feet hit the deck."</p>

<p>Nead stepped off the ledge and tumbled forward, slowly bobbing upright. He reminded Rees of a child entering a pool for the first time. After a few seconds a slow smile spread across the young man's face; and soon he was skimming about the room, his feet brushing at the window below.</p>

<p>Rees took him on a tour around the machines.</p>

<p>Nead shook his head. "This is amazing."</p>

<p>Rees smiled. "This equipment is among the best preserved of the Ship's materiel. It's as if it were unloaded only last shift... We call this place the Observatory. All the heavy-duty sensors are mounted here, and this is where&mdash;as a member of my Nebular physics team&mdash;you'll be spending most of your time." They stopped beside a tube ten feet long and encrusted with lenses. Rees ran a palm along the instrument's jewelled flank. "This baby's my favorite," he said. "Beautiful, isn't she? It's a Telescope which will work at all wavelengths&mdash;including the visual. Using this we can see right down into the heart of the Nebula."</p>

<p>Nead thought that over, then glanced at the ceiling. "Don't we ever need to look outwards?"</p>

<p>Rees nodded approvingly. Good question. "Yes, we do. There are ways of making the roof transparent&mdash;in fact, we can opaque the floor, if we want to." He glanced at the instrument's fist-sized status panel. "We're in luck; there are no observations currently running. I'll give you a quick guided tour of the Nebula. You should know most of what I'll tell you from your studies so far, and don't worry about the details for now..." Slowly he punched a sequence of commands into the keypad mounted below the sensor. He became aware that the lad was watching him curiously. Maybe he's never seen anyone with such rusty keyboard skills, Rees reflected, here on this Raft of a hundred supply machines&mdash;</p>

<p>The stab of old resentment shocked him. Never mind...</p>

<p>A disc of ceiling faded to transparency, revealing a red sky. Rees indicated a monitor plate mounted on a slim post close to the Telescope. The plate abruptly filled with darkness punctuated by fuzzy lens shapes; the lenses were all colors, from red through yellow to the purest blue. Once more Nead gasped.</p>

<p>"Let's review a few facts," Rees began. "You know we live in a Nebula, which is an ellipse-shaped cloud of gas about five thousand miles across. Every particle of the Nebula is orbiting the Core. The Raft is in orbit too, embedded in the Nebula like a fly on a spinning plate; we circle the Core every twelve shifts or so. The Belt mine is further in and only takes about nine shifts to complete its orbit. When the pilots fly between mine and Raft their trees are actually changing orbits...! Fortunately the gradients in orbital speeds are so shallow out here that the velocities the trees can reach are enough for them easily to fly from one orbit to another. Of course the pilots must plan their courses carefully, to make sure the Belt mine isn't on the other side of the Core when they arrive at the right orbit...</p>

<p>"Here we're looking through the Observatory roof and out of the Nebula. Normally the atmosphere shields this view from us, but the Telescope can unscramble the atmospheric scattering and show us what we'd see if the air were stripped away."</p>

<p>Nead peered closer at the picture. "What are those blobs? Are they stars?"</p>

<p>Rees shook his head. "They're other nebulae: some larger than ours, some smaller, some younger&mdash;the blue ones&mdash;and some older. As far as we can see with this Telescope&mdash;and that's hundreds of millions of miles&mdash;space is filled with them.</p>

<p>"All right; let's move inwards." With a single keystroke the picture changed to reveal a blue-purple sky; stars glittered, white as diamonds.</p>

<p>"That's beautiful," Nead breathed. "But it can't be in our Nebula&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is." Rees smiled sadly. "You're looking at the topmost layer, where the lightest gases&mdash;hydrogen and helium&mdash;separate out. That is where stars form. Turbulence causes clumps of higher density; the clumps implode and new stars burst to life." The stars, balls of fusion fire, formed dense bow waves in the thin atmosphere as they began their long, slow fall into the Nebula. Rees went on, "The stars shine for about a thousand shifts before burning out and dropping, as a cool ball of iron, into the Core... Most of them anyway; one or two of the kernels end up in stable orbits around the Core. That's where the star mines come from."</p>

<p>Nead frowned. "And if the path of a falling star intersects the orbit of the Raft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we're in trouble, and we must use the trees to change the Raft's orbit. Fortunately star and Raft converge slowly enough for us to track the star on its way toward us..."</p>

<p>"If new stars are being formed, why do people say the Nebula is dying?"</p>

<p>"Because there are far fewer than before. When the Nebula was formed it was almost pure hydrogen. The stars have turned a lot of the hydrogen into helium, carbon and other heavy elements. That's how the complex substances which support life here were formed.</p>

<p>"Or rather, it's life for us. But it's a slow, choking death for the Nebula. From its point of view oxygen, carbon and the rest are waste products. Heavier than hydrogen, they settle slowly around the Core; the residual hydrogen gets less and less until&mdash;as today&mdash;it's reduced to a thin crust around the Nebula."</p>

<p>Nead stared at the sparse young stars. "What will happen in the end?"</p>

<p>Rees shrugged. "Well, we've observed other nebulae. The last stars will fail and die. Deprived of energy the airborne life of the Nebula&mdash;the whales, the sky wolves, the trees, and the lesser creatures they feed on&mdash;will cease to exist."</p>

<p>"Are there truly such things as whales? I thought they were just stories&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rees shrugged. "We never see them out here, but we have plenty of evidence from travellers who've entered the depths of the Nebula."</p>

<p>"What, as far as the Belt mine, you mean?"</p>

<p>Rees suppressed a smile. "No, even further than that. The Nebula is a big place, lad; there is room to hide a lot of mystery. Perhaps there are even lost human colonies; perhaps the Boneys really exist, and all those legends are true... of the subhuman whale-singers lost in the sky."</p>

<p>The boy shuddered.</p>

<p>"Of course," Rees mused, "there are puzzles about the native life of the Nebula. For example, how can it exist at all? Our records show that life in the home universe took thousands of billions of shifts to evolve. The Nebula isn't anything like that old&mdash;and will be far younger when it dies. So how did life arise?"</p>

<p>"You were telling me what will happen after the stars go out..."</p>

<p>"Yes. The atmosphere, darkened, will steadily lose heat, and&mdash;less able to resist the gravity of the Core&mdash;will collapse. Finally the Nebula will be reduced to a layer a few inches thick around the Core, slowly falling inwards..."</p>

<p>The young man, his face pale, nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"All right," Rees said briskly. "Let's look inwards now&mdash;past the Raft's level, which is a thousand miles from the edge of the Nebula&mdash;and in to the center."</p>

<p>Now the monitor filled up with a familiar ruddy sky. Stars were scattered sparsely through the air. Rees punched a key&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;and stars exploded out of the picture. The focus plummeted into the Nebula and it was as if they were falling.</p>

<p>Finally the star cloud began to thin and a darker knot of matter emerged at its center.</p>

<p>"What you're seeing here is a layer of detritus in close orbit around the Core," Rees said quietly. "At the heart of this Nebula is a black hole. If you're not sure what that is right now, don't worry... The black hole is about a hundredth of an inch wide; the large object we call the Core is a dense mass of material surrounding the hole. We can't see through this cloud of rubble to the Core itself, but we believe it's an ellipsoid about fifty miles across. And somewhere inside the Core will be the black hole itself and an accretion disc around it, a region perhaps a hundred feet wide in which matter is crushed out of existence as it is dragged into the hole...</p>

<p>"At the surface of the Core the hole's gravity is down to a mere several hundred gee. At the outer edge of the Nebula&mdash;where we are&mdash;it's down to about one per cent of a gee; but even though it's so small here the hole's gravity is what binds this Nebula together.</p>

<p>"And if we could travel into the Core itself we would find gravity climbing to thousands, millions of gee. Hollerbach has some theories about what happens near and within the Core, a realm of what he calls 'gravitic chemistry'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nead frowned. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I bet you don't." Rees laughed. "But I'll tell you anyway, so you'll know the questions to ask...</p>

<p>"You see, in the day-to-day turmoil of things we&mdash;even we Scientists&mdash;tend to forget the central, astonishing fact of this cosmos&mdash;that the gravitational constant is a billon times larger than in the universe from which man arose. Oh, we see the macroscopic effects&mdash;for instance, a human body exerts a respectable gravitational field!&mdash;but what about the small, the subtle, the microscopic effects?"</p>

<p>In man's original universe, Rees went on, gravity was the only significant force over the interstellar scale. But over short ranges&mdash;on the scale of an individual atom&mdash;gravity was so tiny as to be negligible. "It is utterly dominated by even the electromagnetic force," Rees said. "And that is why our bodies are shambling cages of electromagnetism; and attractive electrical forces between molecules drive the chemistry that sustains our being.</p>

<p>"But here..." He rubbed his nose thoughtfully. "Here, things are different. Here, in certain circumstances, gravity can be as significant on the atomic scale as other forces&mdash;even dominant.</p>

<p>"Hollerbach talks of a new kind of 'atom.'

uncomfortably; but her face was gaunt, her eyes lost in pools of shadow. "You've changed, Sheen."</p>

<p>She spat laughter. "So has the Belt, Rees. We've seen hard times here."</p>

<p>He narrowed his eyes. Her voice was almost brutal, edged with despair. "If you've the brains I once believed you had," he snapped, "you'll let me help. Let me tell you some of what I've learned."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "This isn't a time for knowledge, boy. This is a time to survive." She looked him up and down. "And believe me, you and the rest of your flabby colleagues are going to find that quite tough enough."</p>

<p>The winch mechanism impelled the chair toward the star kernel. Rees closed his eyes, relaxed his muscles and tried to blank out his mind.</p>

<p>To get through the next shift: that was his only priority now. Just one shift at a time...</p>

<p>If the exile to the Belt had been a descent into hell for Grye, Cipse and the rest, for Rees it had been the meticulous opening of an old wound. Every detail of the Belt&mdash;the shabby cabins, the rain hissing over the surface of the kernel&mdash;had crowded into his awareness, and it was as if the intervening thousands of shifts on the Raft had never been.</p>

<p>But in truth he had changed forever. At least before he had had some hope... Now there was none.</p>

<p>The chair lurched. The dome of rust rocked beneath his feet and already he could sense the tightening pull of the star's gravity field.</p>

<p>The Belt had changed too, he mused... and for the worse. The miners seemed coarsened, brutalized, the Belt itself shabbier and less well maintained. He had learned that deliveries from the Raft had grown less and less frequent. As supplies failed to arrive a vicious circle had set in. Increasing illness and malnutrition and, in the longer term, higher mortality were making it ever harder for the miners to meet their quotas, and without iron to trade even less food could be bought from the Raft&mdash;which worsened the miners' conditions still further.</p>

<p>In such a situation, surely something had to give. But what? Even his old acquaintances&mdash;like Sheen&mdash;were reluctant to talk, as if there was some shameful secret they were hiding. Were the miners making some new arrangements, finding some other, darker, way to break out of the food trap? If so, what?</p>

<p>The wheels of his chair impacted the surface of the star and a full five gees descended on his chest, making him gasp. With a heavy hand he released the cable lock and allowed the chair to roll toward the nearest mine entrance.</p>

<p>"Late again, you feckless bastard." The rumbling voice had issued from the gloom of the mine mouth.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not, Roch; and you know it," Rees said calmly. He brought his chair to a halt at the head of the ramp leading down into the mine.</p>

<p>A chair came whirring up from the gloom. Despite the recent privations the miner Roch was still a huge man. His beard merged with the fur and sweat plastered across his chest; a stomach like a sack slumped over his belt. White showed around his eyes, and when he opened his mouth Rees could see stumps of teeth like burnt bones. "Don't talk back, Raft man." Spittle sprayed his chest in tight parabolae. "What's to stop me putting you all on triple shifts? Eh?"</p>

<p>Rees found the breath escaping from him in a slow sigh. He knew Roch of old. Roch, who you always avoided in the Quartermaster's, whether he was drunk or not. Roch, the half-mad troublemaker who had only been allowed to grow past boyhood, Rees suspected, because of the size of his muscles.</p>

<p>Roch. The obvious choice as the Scientists' shift supervisor.</p>

<p>He was still staring at Rees. "Well? Nothing to say? Eh?"</p>

<p>Rees held his tongue, but the other's fury increased regardless.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Raftshit? Scared of a little work? Eh? I'll show you the meaning of work..." Roch gripped the arms of his chair with fingers like lengths of rope; with separate, massive movements, he hauled his feet off their support plates and planted them on the rust.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the Bones, Roch, you've made your point," Rees protested. "You'll kill yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not me, Raftshit." Now Roch's biceps tightened so that Rees could see the structure of the muscles through the sweat-streaked skin. Slowly, grunting, Roch lifted his bulk from the chair, knees and calves shaking under the load. At last he stood, swaying minutely, arms raised for balance. Five gees hauled at his stomach so that it looked like a sack of mercury slung over his belt; Rees almost cringed as he imagined how the belt must be biting into Roch's flesh.</p>

<p>A grin cracked Roch's purpling face. "Well, Raft man?" Now his tongue protruded from his lips. With slow deliberation he raised his left foot a few inches from the surface and shoved it forward; then the right, then the left again; and so, like a huge, grotesque child, Roch walked on the surface of the star.</p>

<p>Rees watched, not trusting himself to speak.</p>

<p>At length Roch was satisfied. He grabbed the chair arms and lowered himself into the seat. He stared at Rees challengingly, his humor apparently restored by his feat. "Well, come on, Raftshit, there's work to do. Eh?"</p>

<p>And he turned his chair and led the way into the interior of the star.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>Most of the Scientists' work assignments were inside the star mine. For some imagined misdemeanor Roch had long since put them all on double shift. They were allowed an hour's break between shifts&mdash;even Roch had not denied them that yet&mdash;and when the break came Rees met Cipse beneath the glow of a globe lamp.</p>

<p>The Scientists sat in companionable silence for a while. They were in one of the porous kernel's larger chambers; lamps were scattered over its roof like trapped stars, casting light over piles of worked metal and the sullen forms of Moles.</p>

<p>The Navigator looked like a pool of fat in his wheelchair, his small features and short, weak limbs mere addenda to his crushed bulk. Rees, with some effort, helped him raise a tube of water to his lips. The Navigator dribbled; the water scattered over the ruin of his coverall and droplets hit the iron floor like bullets. Cipse smiled apologetically. "I'm sorry," he said, wheezing.</p>

<p>Rees shook his head. "Don't worry about it."</p>

<p>"You know," Cipse said at length, "the physical conditions down here are poor enough; but what makes it unendurable is... the sheer boredom."</p>

<p>Rees nodded. "There has never been much to do save supervise the Moles. They can make their own decisions, mostly, with occasional human intervention. Frankly, though, one or two experienced miners can run the whole kernel. There's no need for so many of us to be down here. It's just Roch's petty way of hurting us."</p>

<p>"Not so petty." Cipse's breath seemed to be labored; his words were punctuated by pauses. "I'm quite concerned about the... health of some of the others, you know. And I suspect... suspect that we would actually be of more use in some other role."</p>

<p>Rees grimaced. "Of course. But try telling Roch."</p>

<p>"You know I've no wish to appear insulting, Rees, but you clearly have more in... common with these people than the... the rest of us." He coughed and clutched his chest. "After all, you are one of them. Can't you... say something?"</p>

<p>Rees laughed softly. "Cipse, I ran out of here, remember. They hate me more than the rest of you. Look, things will get better, I'm sure of that; the miners aren't barbarians. They're just angry. We must be patient."</p>

<p>Cipse fell silent, his breath shallow.</p>

<p>Rees stared at the Navigator in the dim light. Cipse's round face was white and slick with sweat. "You say you're concerned about the well-being of the others, Navigator, but what about yourself?"</p>

<p>Cipse massaged the flesh of his chest. "I can't admit to feeling wonderful," he wheezed. "Of course, just the fact of our presence down here&mdash;in this gravity field&mdash;places a terrible strain on our hearts. Human beings weren't designed, it seems, to function in... such conditions."</p>

<p>"How are you feeling? Do you have any specific pain?"</p>

<p>"Don't fuss, boy," Cipse snapped with the ghost of his old tetchiness. "I'm perfectly all right. And I am the most senior of us, you know. The others... rely on me..." His words were lost in a fit of coughing.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Rees said carefully. "You're the best judge, of course. But&mdash;ah&mdash;since your well-being is so vital to our morale, let me help you, for this one shift. Just stay here; I think I can handle the work of both of us. And I can keep Roch occupied. I'm afraid there's no way he'll let you off the star before the end of the shift, but perhaps if you sit still&mdash;try to sleep even&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cipse thought it over, then said weakly, "Yes. It would feel rather good to sleep." He closed his eyes. "Perhaps that would be for the best. Thank you, Rees..."</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>"No, I don't know what's wrong with him," Rees said. "You're the one with bio training, Grye. He hardly woke up when it came time to return him to the surface. Maybe his heart can't stand up to the gravity down there. But what do I know?"</p>

<p>Cipse lay strapped loosely to a pallet, his face a bowl of perspiration. Grye hovered over the still form of the Navigator, his hands fluttering against each other. "I don't know; I really don't know," he repeated.</p>

<p>The four other Scientists of the group formed an anxious backdrop. The tiny cabin to which they'd all been assigned seemed to Rees a cage of fear and helplessness. "Just think it through," he said, exasperated. "What would Hollerbach do if he were here?"</p>

<p>Grye drew in his stomach pompously and glowered up at Rees. "May I point out that Hollerbach isn't here? And furthermore, on the Raft we had access to dispensers of the finest drugs&mdash;as well as the Ship's medical records. Here we have nothing, not even full rations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing except yourselves!" Rees snapped.</p>

<p>A circle of round, grime-streaked faces stared at him, apparently hurt.</p>

<p>Rees sighed. "I'm sorry," he said. "Look, Grye, there's nothing I can suggest. You must have learned something in all the years you worked with those records. You'll simply have to do what you think best."</p>

<p>Grye frowned, and for long seconds studied Cipse's recumbent form; then he began to loosen the Navigator's clothing.</p>

<p>Rees turned away. With his duty fulfilled claustrophobia swiftly descended on him, and he pushed his way out of the cabin.</p>

<p>He prowled the confines of the Belt. He met few people: it was approaching mid-shift and most Belt folk must be at work or in their cabins. Rees breathed lungfuls of Nebula air and gloomily studied the over-familiar details of the little colony's construction: the battered cabins, walls scarred by generations of passing hands and feet, the gaping nozzles of the roof jets.</p>

<p>A breeze brought him a distant scent of wood, and he looked up. Hanging in the sky in tight formation was the flight of trees which had brought him here from the Raft. The bulk of the supply machine was still slung between them, and Rees made out Pallis's overseer tree hovering in the background. The elegant trees, the faint foliage scent, the figures clambering through the branches: the airy spectacle was quite beautiful, and it brought home to Rees with a sudden, sharp impact the magnitude of what he had lost in returning here.</p>

<p>The rotation of the Belt swept the formation over a horizon of cabins. Rees turned away.</p>

<p>He came to the Quartermaster's. Now the smell of stale alcohol filled his head and on impulse he slid into the bar's gloomy interior. Maybe a couple of shots of something tough would help his mood; relax him enough to get the sleep he needed&mdash;</p>

<p>The barman, Jame, was rinsing drink bowls in a bag of grimy water. He scowled through his gray-tinged beard. "I've told you before," he growled. "I don't serve Raft shite in here."</p>

<p>Rees hid his anger under a grin. He glanced around the bar; it was empty save for a small man with a spectacular burn scar covering one complete forearm. "Looks like you don't serve anyone else either," Rees snapped.</p>

<p>Jame grunted. "Don't you know? This shift they're finally going to offload that supply machine from the trees; that's where all the able bodies are. Work to do, see&mdash;not like you feckless Raft shite&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rees felt his anger uncoil. "Come on, Jame. I was born here. You know that."</p>

<p>"And you chose to leave. Once a Rafter, always a Rafter."</p>

<p>"Jame, it's a small Nebula," Rees snapped. "I've seen enough to teach me that much at least. And we're all humans in it together, Belt and Raft alike&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jame had turned his back.</p>

<p>Rees, irritated, left the bar. It had been&mdash;how long? a score of shifts?&mdash;since their arrival at the Belt, and the miners had only just worked out how to unship the supply device. And he, Rees, with experience of tree flight and of Belt conditions, hadn't even been told they were doing it...</p>

<p>He anchored his toes in the wall of the Quartermaster's and stretched to his full height, peering at the formation of trees beyond the far side of the Belt. Now that he looked more carefully he could see there were many people clinging awkwardly to the branches. Men swarmed over the net containing the supply device, dwarfed by its ragged bulk; they tied ropes around it and threw out lengths that uncoiled toward the Belt.</p>

<p>At last a loose web of rope trailed from the machine. Tiny shouts crossed the air; Rees could see the pilots standing beside the trunks of the great trees, and now billows of smoke bloomed above the canopies. With massive grandeur the trees' rotation slowed and they began to inch toward the Belt. The coordination was skillful; Rees could see how the supply machine barely rocked through the air.</p>

<p>The actual transfer to the Belt would surely be the most difficult part. Perhaps the formation would move to match the Belt's rotation, so that the dangling ropes could be hauled in until the machine settled as a new component of the chain of buildings. Presumably that was how much of the Belt had been constructed&mdash;though generations ago...</p>

<p>One tree dropped a little too fast. The machine rocked. Workers cried out, clinging to the nets. Tree-pilots called and waved their arms. Slowly the smoke over the offending tree thickened and the formation's motion slowed.</p>

<p>Damn it, thought Rees furiously, he should be up there! He was still strong and able despite the poor rations and back-crushing work&mdash;</p>

<p>With a distant, slow rip, the net parted.</p>

<p>Rees, wrapped in introspective anger, took a second to perceive the meaning of what he saw. Then all of his being seemed to lock on that small point in the sky.</p>

<p>The pilots worked desperately, but the net became a mist of shreds and tatters; the formation dissolved in slow lurches of wood and smoke. Men wriggled in the air, rapidly drifting apart. The supply machine, freed of its constraints, hovered as if uncertain what to do. One man, Rees saw, was still clinging to the side of the machine itself.</p>

<p>The machine began to fall; soon it was sailing toward the Belt in a slow curve.</p>

<p>Rees dropped to hands and knees and clung tightly to the Belt cables. Where was the damn thing headed? The gravity fields of both star kernel and Nebula Core were hauling at the machine; the Core field was by far the most powerful, but was the machine close enough to the star for the latter to predominate?</p>

<p>The machine could pass through the structure of the Belt like a fist through wet paper.</p>

<p>The immediate loss of life would be enormous, of course; and within minutes the Belt, its integrity gone, would be torn apart by its own spin. A ring-shaped cloud of cabins, trailing pipes, rope fragments and squirming people would disperse until at last each survivor would be alone in the air, facing the ultimate fall into the Core...</p>

<p>Or, Rees's insistent imagination demanded, what if the machine missed the Belt but went on to impact the star kernel? He recalled the craters left even by raindrops at the base of a five-gee gravity well; what would the roaring tons of the supply machine do? He imagined a great splash of molten iron which would spray out over the Belt and its occupants. Perhaps the integrity of the star itself would be breached...</p>

<p>The tumbling supply machine loomed over him; he stared up, fascinated. He made out details of dispenser nozzles and input keyboards, and he was reminded incongruously of more orderly times, of queuing for supplies at the Rim of the Raft. Now he saw the man who still clung to the machine's ragged wall. He was dark-haired and long-boned and he seemed quite calm. For a moment his eyes locked with Rees's, and then the slow rotation of the machine took him from Rees's view.</p>

<p>The machine grew until it seemed close enough to touch.</p>

<p>Then, with heart-stopping slowness, it slid sideways. The great bulk whooshed by a dozen yards from the closest point of the Belt. As it neared the star kernel its trajectory curved sharply, and then it was hurled away, still tumbling.</p>

<p>Its human occupant a mote on its flank, its path slowly arcing downwards toward the Core, the machine dwindled into infinity.</p>

<p>Above Rees the six scattered trees began to converge. With shouted calls ropes were thrown to workers still stranded in the air.</p>

<p>As fear of a spectacular death faded, Rees began to experience the loss of the machine as an almost physical pain. Yet another fragment of man's tiny heritage lost through stupidity and blundering... And with every piece gone their chances of surviving the next few generations were surely shrinking even further.</p>

<p>Then he recalled what Pallis had told him of Decker's calculations. The revolution's subtle leader-to-be had hinted darkly that he had no fear of a loss of economic power over the Belt despite the planned gift of a supply machine. Was it possible that this act had been deliberate? Had lives been wasted, an irreplaceable device hurled away, all for some short-term political advantage?</p>

<p>Rees felt as if he were suspended over a void, as if he were one of the unfortunates lost in the catastrophe; but the depths were composed not of air but of the baseness of human nature.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>At the start of the next shift Cipse was too weak to be moved; so Rees agreed with Grye and the rest that he should be left undisturbed in the Belt. When Rees reached the surface of the star kernel he told Roch the situation. He kept his words factual, his tone meek and apologetic. Roch glowered, thick eyebrows knotting, but he said nothing, and Rees made his way into the depths of the star.</p>

<p>At mid-shift he rode back to the surface for a break&mdash;and was met by the sight of Cipse. The Navigator was wrapped in a grimy blanket and was weakly reaching for the controls of a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Rees rattled painfully over the star's tiny hills to Cipse. He reached out and laid a hand as gently as possible on the Scientist's arm. "Cipse, what the hell's going on? You're ill, damn it; you were supposed to stay in the Belt."</p>

<p>Cipse turned his eyes to Rees; he smiled, his face a bloodless white. "I didn't get a lot of choice, I'm afraid, my young friend."</p>

<p>"Roch..."</p>

<p>"Yes." Cipse closed his eyes, still fumbling for the controls of his chair.</p>

<p>"You got something to say about it, Raftshit?"</p>

<p>Rees turned his chair. Roch faced him, his corrupted mouth spread into a grin.</p>

<p>Rees tried to compute a way through this&mdash;to search for a lever that might influence this gross man and save his companion&mdash;but his rationality dissolved in a tide of rage. "You bastard, Roch," he hissed. "You're murdering us. And yet you're not as guilty as the folk up there who are letting you do it."</p>

<p>Roch assumed an expression of mock surprise. "You're not happy, Raftshit? Well, I'll tell you what&mdash;" He hauled himself to his feet. Face purpling, massive fists bunched, he grinned at Rees. "Why don't you do something about it? Come on. Get out of that chair and face me, right now. And if you can put me down&mdash;why, then, you can tuck your little friend up again."</p>

<p>Rees closed his eyes. Oh, by the Bones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't listen to him, Rees."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too late, Cipse," he whispered. He gripped the arms of his chair and tensed his back experimentally. "After what I was stupid enough to say he's not going to let me off this star alive. At least this way you have a chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted his left foot from its supporting platform; it felt as if a cage of iron were strapped to his leg. Now the right...</p>

<p>And, without giving himself time to think about it, with a single, vein-bursting heave he pushed himself out of his chair.</p>

<p>Pain lapped in great sheets over the muscles of his thighs, calves and back. For a terrible instant he thought he was going to topple forward, to smash face-down into the iron. Then he was stable. His breathing was shallow and he could feel his heart rattle in its cage of bones; it was as if he bore a huge, invisible weight strapped to his back.</p>

<p>He looked up and faced Roch, tried to force a grin onto his swollen face.</p>

<p>"Another attempt at self-sacrifice, Rees?" Cipse said softly. "Godspeed, my friend."</p>

<p>Roch's smile seemed easy, as if the five gees were no more than a heavy garment. Now he lifted one massive leg, forced it through the air and drove his foot into the rust. Another step, and another; at last he was less than a yard from Rees, close enough for Rees to smell the sourness of his breath. Then, grunting with the effort, he lifted one huge fist.</p>

<p>Rees tried to lift his arms over his head, but it was as if they were bound to his sides by massive ropes. He closed his eyes. For some reason a vision of the young, white stars at the fringe of the Nebula came to him; and his fear dissolved. A shadow crossed his face.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>He opened his eyes. He saw red sky&mdash;and pain lanced through his skull.</p>

<p>But he was alive, and the loading of the star's five gees had gone. There was a cool surface at his back and neck; he ran his hands over it and felt the gritty surface of an iron plate. The plate juddered beneath him; his stomach tightened and he gagged, dry. His mouth was sour, his tongue like a piece of wood, and he wondered how long he had lain unconscious.</p>

<p>Cautiously he propped himself on one elbow. The plate was about ten feet on a side; over it had been cast a rough net to which he was tethered by a rope around his waist. A pile of roughly cut iron was fixed near the center of the plate. The plate had one other occupant: the barman, Jame, who regarded Rees incuriously as he chewed on a piece of old-looking meat-sim. "You're awake, then," he said. "I thought Roch had bust your skull wide open; you've been out for hours."</p>

<p>Rees stared at him; then the plate gave another shudder. Rees sat up, testing the gravity&mdash;it was tiny and wavering&mdash;and looked around.</p>

<p>The Belt hung in the air perhaps half a mile away, surrounding its star kernel like a crude bracelet around a child's wrist.</p>

<p>So he was flying. On a metal plate? Vertigo swept through him and he wrapped his fingers in the net.</p>

<p>At length he made his way slowly to the edge of the plate, ducked his head to the underside. He saw four jet nozzles fixed at the corners of the plate, the small drive boxes obviously taken from Belt rooftops. Occasionally, in response to tugs by Jame on control strings, the nozzles would spout steam and the plate would kick through the air.</p>

<p>So the miners had invented flying machines while he had been gone. Why, he wondered, did they need them all of a sudden?</p>

<p>He straightened up and sat once more facing Jame. Now the barman was sucking water from a globe; at first he acted as if unaware of Rees, but at length, with a hint of pity on his broad, bearded features, he passed Rees the globe.</p>

<p>Rees allowed the water to pour over his tongue, slide down his parched throat. He passed the globe back. "Come on, Jame. Tell me what's going on. What happened to Cipse?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The Nav&mdash;The Scientist. The ill one."</p>

<p>Jame looked blank. "One of them died down there. Heart packed up, I heard. A fat old guy. Is that who you mean?"</p>

<p>Rees sighed. "Yes, Jame; that's who I mean."</p>

<p>Jame studied him; then he pulled a bottle from his waistband, unstopped it and took a deep draught.</p>

<p>"Jame, why aren't I dead also?"</p>

<p>"You should be. Roch thought he had killed you; that's why he didn't hit you any more. He had you hauled up and brought to the damn Quartermaster's&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;and then you started to groan a bit, move around. Roch was all for finishing you off there and then, but I told him, 'Not in my bar, you don't...' Then Sheen showed up."</p>

<p>Something like hope spread through Rees. "Sheen?"</p>

<p>"She knew I was due to leave on this ferry so I guess that gave her the idea to get you off the Belt." Jame's eyes slid past Rees. "Sheen is a decent woman. Maybe this was the only way she could think of to save you. But I'll tell you, Roch was happy enough to send you out here. A slower, painful death for you; that's what he thought he was settling for..."</p>

<p>"What? Where are you taking me?" Rees, confused, questioned Jame further; but the barman lapsed into silence, nursing his bottle.</p>

<p>Under Jame's direction the little craft descended into the Nebula. The atmosphere became thicker, warmer, harder to breathe; it was like the air in a too-enclosed room. The Nebula grew dark; the enfeebled stars shone brightly against the gloom. Rees spent long hours at the lip of the plate, staring into the abyss below. In the darkness at the very heart of the Nebula Rees fancied he could see all the way to the Core, as if he were back in the Observatory.</p>

<p>There was no way of telling the time; Rees estimated several shifts had passed before Jame said abruptly, "You mustn't judge us, you know."</p>

<p>Rees looked up. "What?"</p>

<p>Jame was nursing a half-finished bottle; he lay awkwardly against the plate, eyes misty with drink. "We all have to survive. Right? And when the shipments of supplies from the Raft dried up, there was only one place to go for food..." He thumped his bottle against the plate and fixed Rees with a stare. "I opposed it, I can tell you. I said it was better that we should die than trade with such people. But it was a group decision. And I accept it." He waggled a finger at Rees. "It was the choice of all of us, and I accept my share of the responsibility."</p>

<p>Rees stared, baffled, and Jame seemed to sober a little. Then surprise, even wonder, spread across the barman's face. "You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?"</p>

<p>"Jame, I haven't the faintest idea. Nobody told us exiles a damn thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jame half-laughed, scratching his head. Then he glanced around the sky, picking out a few of the brighter stars, clearly judging the plate's position. "Well, you'll find out soon enough. We're nearly there. Take a look, Rees. Below us, to my right somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rees turned onto his belly and thrust his face below the plate. At first he could see nothing in the direction Jame had indicated&mdash;then, squinting, he made out a small, dark speck of matter.</p>

<p>The hours wore on. Jame carefully adjusted the thrust from the jets. The speck grew to a ball the color of dried blood. At length Rees made out human figures standing on or crawling over all sides of the ball, as if glued there; judging from their size the sphere must have been perhaps thirty yards wide.</p>

<p>Jame joined him. With absent-minded companionship he passed Rees his bottle. "Here. Now, look, boy; what you have to remember if you want to last here more than a half-shift is that these are human beings just like you and me..."</p>

<p>They were nearing the surface now. The sphere-world was quite crowded with people, adults and children; they went naked, or wore ragged tunics, and were uniformly short, squat and well-muscled. One man stood under their little craft, watching their approach.</p>

<p>The surface of the worldlet was composed of sheets of something like dried cloth. Hair sprouted from it here and there. In one place the sheets were ripped, exposing the interior structure of the worldlet.</p>

<p>Rees saw the white of bone.</p>

<p>He took a shuddering pull at Jame's bottle.</p>

<p>The man below raised his head; his eyes met Rees's, and the Boney raised his arms as if in welcome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">9</h3>

<p>Jame brought the plate to a smooth landing on the crackling surface of the worldlet. Silently he set to work unlashing the batches of iron from the net.</p>

<p>Rees clung to the net and stared wildly around. The cramped horizon was made up of sheets of hairy, brownish material, stirring sluggishly. Again Rees saw the white of bone protruding through breaks in the surface.</p>

<p>He felt his bladder loosen. He closed his eyes and clamped down. Come on, Rees; you've faced greater perils than this, more immediate dangers...</p>

<p>But the Boneys were a myth from his childhood, sleep-time monsters to frighten recalcitrant children. Surely, in a universe which contained the calm, machined interior of the Bridge, there was no room for such ugliness?</p>

<p>"Welcome," a high, dry voice said. "So you've yet another guest for us, Jame?" The man Rees had seen from the air was standing over the plate now, accepting an armful of iron from Jame. A few conventional-looking food packages were stacked at the man's feet. Briskly Jame bundled them onto the plate and fixed them to the net.</p>

<p>The Boney was squat and barrel-chested, his head a wrinkled, hairless globe. He was dressed in a crudely cut sheet of surface material. He grinned and Rees saw that his cavernous mouth was totally without teeth. "What's the matter, boy? Aren't you going to give old Quid a hand?"</p>

<p>Rees found his fingers tightening about the strands of the net. Jame stood over him with a package of iron. "Come on, lad. Take this stuff and get off the plate. You haven't any choice, you know. And if you show you're afraid it will go the worse for you."</p>

<p>Rees felt a whimper rising in his throat; it was as if all the revolting speculation he had ever heard about the Boneys' way of life had returned to unman him.</p>

<p>He clamped his lips together. Damn it, he was a Scientist Second Class. He summoned up the steady, tired gaze of Hollerbach. He would come through this. He had to.</p>

<p>He untwined his fingers from the netting and stood up, forcing the rational half of his mind to work. He felt heavy, sluggish; the gravity was perhaps one and a half gee. So the mass of the little planet must have been&mdash;what? Thirty tons?</p>

<p>He took the iron and, without hesitation, stepped off the plate and onto the surface. His feet sank a few inches into the stuff. It was soft, like a coarse cloth, and covered with hair strands which scratched his ankles; and, oh, god, it was warm, like the hide of some huge animal&mdash;</p>

<p>Or human.</p>

<p>Now, to his horror, his bladder released; dampness slid down his legs.</p>

hot, foul gas billowed out over him, causing him to gasp, his eyes to stream. The ruptured cartilage began to sag. Soon a great fold of it was suspended beneath the belly of the whale; Rees clung on, still swinging painfully.</p>

<p>Now a ripple a foot high came rolling down the whale's belly wall. The whale's nervous system must be slow to react, but surely it could feel the agony of this massive hernia. The wave reached the site of the rupture. The dangling fold of cartilage jerked up and down, once, twice, again; Rees's shoulders felt as if they were being dragged from their sockets and needles thrust into the joints.</p>

<p>Again his fingers loosened.</p>

<p>The rip in the sheet was like a narrow door above him.</p>

<p>Shoulders shaking, Rees hauled himself up until his chin was level with his fists. He released his left hand&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;and almost fell altogether; but his right hand still clutched at the cartilage, and now his left hand was locked over the lip of the wound. He released his right hand; the weaker, numb left slipped over greasy cartilage but&mdash;now&mdash;he had both hands clamped at the edge of the aperture.</p>

<p>He rested there for a few seconds, the muscles of his arms screaming, his fingers slipping.</p>

<p>Now he worked the muscles of his back and dragged his feet up before his face, shoved them over his head and through the aperture. Then his legs and back slid easily over the inner surface of the cartilage and into the body of the whale, and finally he was able to uncurl his fingers. With the last of his strength he rolled away from the aperture.</p>

<p>Breathing hard he lay on his back, spread-eagled against the whale's inner stomach wall. Below him, obscured by the translucent flesh, were the wheeling stars, and far above, like huge machines in some vast, dimly lit hall, were the organs of the whale.</p>

<p>His lungs rattled; his arms and hands were on fire. Blackness fell over him and the pain dropped away.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>He awoke to a raging thirst.</p>

<p>He stared up into the cavernous interior of the whale. The light seemed dimmer: perhaps the whale, for reasons of its own, was flying deeper into the Nebula.</p>

<p>The air was hot, damp, and foul with a stench like sweat; but, though his chest ached slightly, he seemed to be breathing normally. Cautiously he propped himself up on his elbows. The muscles of his arms felt ripped and the fingernails on both hands were torn; but the bones of his fingers seemed intact and in place.</p>

<p>He climbed cautiously to his feet.</p>

<p>Stars still wheeled around the whale, but if he averted his eyes he felt no dizziness. It was as if he were standing in a steady gravity well of about two gees. Looking down he saw that his bare feet had sunk a couple of inches into the resilient cartilage. With some experimentation he found he could walk with little difficulty, provided he avoided slipping on the slick surface.</p>

<p>Again thirst tore at his throat; it felt as if the back of his mouth were closing up with the dryness.</p>

<p>He made his way to the aperture he had torn in the cartilage sheet. The wound had already closed to a narrow slit barely as wide as his waist. He had no way of telling how long he had been unconscious, but surely it must have taken a shift at least for the healing to progress this far. He knelt down, the cartilage beneath his knees a warm, wet carpet, and pushed his face close to the wound. A breeze bore him welcome fresh air. He could see the dangling flap of cartilage up which he had scrambled to safety: the ripped skin had grown opaque and was covered in a mass of fine creases. Perhaps eventually the dangling fold would be isolated outside the body, atrophy and fall away.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rees's scrambling the area of cartilage around the wound was scraped clear of flesh; only a few clumps clung here and there, like isolated patches of foliage on an old tree. Rees lay on the warm floor, took a fold of cartilage in his left hand, and thrust his head and right arm out through the wound. He swept his arm around the outer wall of the whale's belly, hauling in as much flesh matter as he could reach. As he worked the breeze of the whale's rotation washed steadily over his face and bare arms.</p>

<p>When he was done he withdrew from the wound and hauled away his meager supply. He shoved a fistful into his mouth immediately. Sticky whale juice trickled, soothing, down his parched throat and fluffy flesh clung to his straggling beard; he squatted on the warm floor and, for a few minutes, ate steadily, postponing thoughts of an impossible future.</p>

<p>When he was done, his thirst and hunger at least partially sated, his pile of flesh was reduced by at least half. The damn stuff would last hardly any time at all... He crammed the rest into the pockets of his filthy coverall.</p>

<p>Now he became aware of another problem, as the pressure in his bladder and lower bowels began to grow painful. He felt oddly reluctant to relieve himself inside the body of another creature; it seemed an obscene violation. But, the muscles of his lower stomach told him, he didn't really have a lot of choice.</p>

<p>At last he loosened his trousers and squatted over the narrowest section of the rent in the stomach wall.</p>

<p>He had a bizarre image of his waste being flung through the air in a cloud of brown and yellow. It was highly unlikely, of course, but perhaps one day the stuff would reach the Belt, or the Raft; would one of his acquaintances look up in horror for the source of this foul rain&mdash;and think of him?</p>

<p>He laughed out loud; the sound was absorbed by the soft wall around him. He could think of a few nominations for the recipient of such a message. Gover, Roch, Quid... Maybe he should take aim.</p>

<p>His needs satisfied, his curiosity began to reassert itself, and he stared around at the mysterious interior of the whale. It was like being inside some great, glass-walled ship. From the leading face a wide tube stretched down the axis of the body, contracting as it neared the rear. Entrails of some kind branched off, looking like fat, pale worms that coiled around the principal esophagus. Sacs which could hold four men were suspended around the axial tube, filled with obscure, unmoving forms. Organs were clustered around the main axial canal; and others, vast and anonymous, were fixed to the inner wall of the skin.</p>

<p>Beyond the body's rear Rees could make out the joint to the fluke section, and then the great semicircular flukes themselves, washing through the air with immense assurance and power. The motion of the flukes and the wheeling shadows cast by the starlight through the translucent skin gave the place a superficial impression of motion; but otherwise, apart from a subdued humming, the vast space was still and calm. Rees had read of the great cathedrals of Earth; he remembered staring at the old pictures and wondering what it would be like to stand inside such ancient, huge, still spaces.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be something like this.</p>

<p>Stepping cautiously over the slippery, yielding surface, he began to make his way toward the whale's leading face.</p>

<p>He neared an organ fixed to the floor. It was an opaque, flattened sphere, twice as tall as he was, and its mass tugged gently at him. He pressed his palm to the tough, lumpy flesh; beneath the surface he could feel hot liquid churn. Perhaps this was the equivalent of a liver or kidney. Crouching, he could see how the organ was attached to the stomach wall by a tight, wrinkled ring of flesh; the ring was clear enough for him to see liquid pulse to and from the dense cartilage.</p>

<p>A Boney spear protruded from the organ, its tip buried an arm's length inside the soft material. Rees took the shaft and carefully slid the spear away from the organ; it emerged damp and sticky. He propped the spear safely within a fold of flesh and walked on.</p>

<p>The floor slanted sharply upwards as he began to climb the slope of the body toward the axis of rotation. At last he was climbing a near-vertical, sheer surface, and he was forced to dig his hands into the cartilage. As he climbed toward the axis the centripetal force lessened, although a Coriolis effect began to make him stagger.</p>

<p>He paused for breath and looked back over the slope he had climbed. The organs fixed to the apparent floor and walls of the chamber were like mysterious engines. The tube of the esophagus stretched away above his head; he noticed now that wrapped around it, close behind the eyes, was a large, spongy mass; filaments like rope connected the sponge to the eyes&mdash;optic nerves? Perhaps the convoluted lump was the whale's brain; if so its mass relative to its body must compare favorably with a human's.</p>

<p>Could the whale be intelligent? That seemed absurd... but then he remembered the song of the Boney hunters. The whale must have a reasonably sophisticated sensorium to be able to respond to such a lure.</p>

<p>At last he reached a position just below the join of the esophagus to the face. The whale's triple eyes hung over him like vast lamps, staring calmly ahead; it felt as if he were clinging to the inside of some huge mask.</p>

<p>The face rippled, almost casting him free; he clung tighter to the cartilage. Staring up he saw that the center of the face had split, becoming an open mouth which led directly into the huge throat.</p>

<p>Rees looked out through the face. He made out a blur of motion which slowly resolved itself into a shoal of ghost-white plates which whirled in the air before the whale. These plate creatures were no more than three or four feet wide; some of them, perhaps the young, were far smaller. The creatures had upturned rims&mdash;no doubt for aerodynamic reasons&mdash;and Rees saw how purplish veins crisscrossed the upper surface of the discs.</p>

<p>The creatures scattered in alarm as the whale approached. The whale's three eyes locked on the plate animals, triangulating with hungry precision. Soon the plates were impacting the great, flat face; the cartilage resounded like a drumskin, making Rees flinch. Doomed plate creatures, still spinning feebly, slid into the whale's maw and disappeared into the opaque esophagus, and soon a series of bulges were passing down the great tube. Rees imagined the still living plates hurling themselves against the walls that had closed around them after a lifetime of free air. After some minutes the first bulge reached a branch to the semitransparent entrails. Battered plates emerged into the comparative stillness of the intestines, some still turning feebly. With vast pulses of clear muscle the bodies were worked along the entrails, dissolving as they moved through vats of digestive gases or fluids.</p>

<p>For perhaps thirty minutes the whale cut a path through the cloud of plate creatures... and then something fast moved at the rim of Rees's peripheral vision. He twisted, peering.</p>

<p>There was a blur, something red and dense that shot across the sky. Now another, and a third; and now a whole flock of them, raining through the air like missiles. The things descended on the shoal of plate creatures in a great, frenzied blur of motion and blood; when they moved on they left behind a cloud of blood and meat scraps&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;and one of the blurs flew at Rees's face. He cried out and flinched backwards, almost losing his grip on the cartilage mask; then he steadied himself and stared back at the creature.</p>

<p>It had come to a halt mere yards before him. It was little more than a flying mouth. A red stump of a body, limbless, perhaps two yards long, was fronted by a circular maw wider than Rees could reach. Eyes like beads clustered round the mouth, which was ringed by long teeth, needle points turned inwards. Now the mouth closed, the flesh stretching over a rudimentary bone structure, until teeth met in a grind of white flashes.</p>

<p>Rees could almost imagine this sky wolf licking its lips as it studied him.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the whale fixed the wolf with a haughty glare, and after a few seconds the wolf shot away to join its companions amid the easier meat of the plate creatures.</p>

<p>Apparently satiated, the whale surged out of the cloud of plates and into clear air. Looking back, Rees could see the sky wolves continue to feast on the hapless plates.</p>

<p>The sky wolves were creatures of children's tales; Rees had never encountered one before. No doubt, like uncounted other species of Nebula flora and fauna, the plates and wolves were careful to avoid the homes of man. Was he the first human to see such a sight? And would the Nebula die before mankind could explore the marvels this strange universe had to offer?</p>

<p>A heavy depression fell upon Rees, and he pressed his face against the inner face of the whale.</p>

<p>The whale forged ever deeper into the heart of the Nebula; the air outside grew darker.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>Rees woke from a dream of falling.</p>

<p>His back was pressed against the inner face of the whale, his hands locked around folds of cartilage; cautiously he uncurled his fingers and worked the stiff joints.</p>

<p>What had woken him? He scanned the cavernous interior of the whale. Shafts of starlight still swept through the body like torch beams&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;but, surely, more slowly than before. Was the whale coming to rest?</p>

<p>He turned to look out of the whale's face... and felt a tingle of wonder at the base of his skull. Peering in at him, not a dozen yards from where he stood, were the three eyes of a second whale. Its face was pressed to that of "his" whale, and he saw how the mouths of the two vast creatures worked in sympathetic patterns, almost as if they were speaking to each other.</p>

<p>Now the other whale peeled away, its flukes beating, and the view ahead cleared. Again wonder surged through Rees, causing him to gasp. Beyond the second whale was another, side on, forging through the air&mdash;and beyond that another, and another; as far as Rees's eyes could see, above him and below him, there was a great array of whales which swam through the Nebula. The school must have been spread through cubic miles: the more distant of them were like tiny lanterns illuminated by starlight.</p>

<p>Like a great, pinkish river, the whales were all streaming toward the Core.</p>

<p>From behind Rees there was a low grind, as if some great machine were stirring. Turning, he saw that the joint connecting the main body of the whale to its fluke section was swivelling; bones and muscles the size of men hauled at the mass of turning flesh. Soon the whale was banking around a wide arc, its flukes beating purposefully. The whale's rotation increased once more, turning the school of whales into a kaleidoscope of whirling flukes; and at last the whale settled into a place in the vast migration.</p>

<p>For hours the school forged on into increasing darkness. The stars at these depths were older, dimmer, their proximity increasing as the Core neared. Rees made out two stars so close they almost touched: their tired fires were drawn out in great mounds, and they whirled around each other in a pirouette seconds long. Later the whales passed a massive star, miles across; its fusion processes seemed exhausted, but the iron of its surface, compressed by gravity, gave off a dull, somber glow. The surface was a place of constant motion: every few minutes a portion would subside, leaving a crater perhaps yards wide and a spray of molten particles struggling a few feet into the air. Smaller stars circled the giant in orbits of several minutes, and Rees was reminded of Hollerbach's orrery: here was another "solar system" model, made not of metal beads but of stars...</p>

<p>The school reached another collection of stars bound by gravity; but this time there was no central giant: instead a dozen small stars, some still burning, whirled through a complex, chaotic dance. At one moment it seemed two stars must collide... but no; they passed no more than yards apart, spun around and hurtled off in new directions. The motion of the star family showed no structure, no periodicity&mdash;and Rees, who in his time on the Raft had studied the chaotic aspects of the three-body problem, was not surprised.</p>

<p>Still the gloom deepened. A gathering blackness ahead told Rees they were nearing the Core. He remembered the Telescopic journey into the Nebula he had taken at the time of the revolt with that young Class Three&mdash;what was his name? Nead? Little had he dreamt that one day he would repeat the journey in person, and in such a fantastic fashion...</p>

<p>Again he thought briefly of Hollerbach. What would that old man give to be seeing these wonders? A mood of contentment, perhaps brought on by his memories, settled over Rees.</p>

<p>Now, as on his Telescopic journey, the mists of the Nebula's heart lifted away like veils from a face, and he began to make out the sphere of debris around the Core itself. Through breaks in the shell of rubble a pink light flickered.</p>

<p>Slowly Rees began to realize he was staring at his own death. What would get him first? The hard radiation sleeting from the black hole? Perhaps the tidal effects of the Core's gravitation would tear his head and limbs from his body... or, as the softer structure of the whale disintegrated, maybe he would find himself tumbling helpless in the air, baked or asphyxiated in the oxygen-starved atmosphere.</p>

<p>But still the odd mood of contentment lingered, and now he felt a slow, soothing music sound within his head. He let his muscles relax and he settled comfortably against the inner face of the whale. If this really were to be his death&mdash;well, at least it had been an interesting journey.</p>

<p>And perhaps, after all, death wouldn't be the final end. He recalled some of the simple religious beliefs of the Belt. What if the soul survived the body, somehow? What if his journey were to continue on some other plane? He was struck by a vision of a stream of disembodied souls streaking out into space, their flukes slowly beating&mdash;</p>

<p>Flukes? What the hell&mdash;?</p>

<p>He shook his head, trying to clear it of the bizarre images and sounds. Damn it, he knew himself well enough to know that he shouldn't be facing death with an elegiac smile and a vision of the afterlife. He should be fighting, looking for a way out...</p>

<p>But if these thoughts weren't his own, whose were they?</p>

<p>With a shudder he turned and stared at the bulge of brain around the whale's esophagus. Could the beast be semitelepathic? Were the images seeping into his head from that great mound, mere yards from him?</p>

<p>He remembered how the chanting of the Boney hunters had attracted the whales. Perhaps the chanting set up some sort of telepathic lure which baffled and attracted the whales. With a start he realized that the steady music in his head had the same structure, the same compelling rhythm and cyclical melodies, as the Boneys' song. It must be coming from outside him&mdash;though whether through his ears or by telepathic means he found it impossible to distinguish. So the Boneys, perhaps by chance, had found a way to make the whales believe they were swimming, not toward a slow death at the hands of tiny, malevolent humans, but toward&mdash;</p>

<p>What? Where did these whales, swimming to the Core, think they were going, and why were they so happy to be going there?</p>

<p>There was only one way to find out. He quailed at the thought of opening his mind to further violation; but he fixed his hands tightly around the cartilage, closed his eyes, and tried to welcome the bizarre images.</p>

<p>Again the whales streaked into the air. He tried to observe the scene as if it were a photograph before him. Were these things really whales? Yes; but somehow their bulk had been reduced drastically, so that they became pencil-shaped missiles soaring against minimal air resistance to... where? He struggled, compressing his eyes with the back of one hand, but it wouldn't come. Well, wherever it was, "his" whale felt nothing but delight at the prospect.</p>

<p>If he couldn't see the destination, what about the source?</p>

<p>Deliberately he lowered his head. The image in his mind panned down, as if he were tracking a Telescope across the sky.</p>

<p>And he saw the source of the whales' flight. It was the Core.</p>

<p>He opened gritty eyes. So the creatures were not plunging to their deaths; somehow they were going to use the Core to gain enormous velocities, enough to send them hurtling out&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;out, he realized with a sudden burst of insight, of the Nebula itself.</p>

<p>The whales knew the Nebula was dying. And, in this fantastic fashion, they were migrating; they would abandon the fading ruin of the Nebula and cross space to a new home. Perhaps they had done this dozens, hundreds of times before; perhaps they had spread among the nebulae in this way for hundreds of thousands of shifts...</p>

<p>And what the whales could do, surely man could emulate. A great wave of hope crashed over Rees; he felt the blood burn in his cheeks.</p>

<p>The Core was very near now; shafts of hellish light glared through the shell of debris, illuminating the rubble. Ahead of him he could see whales expelling air through their mouths in great moist plumes; their bodies contracted like slowly collapsing balloons.</p>

<p>The rotation of Rees's whale slowed. Soon it would enter the deepening throat of the Core's gravity well... and surely Rees would die. As rapidly as it had grown his bubble of hope disintegrated, wiping away the last traces of his false contentment. He had perhaps minutes to live, and locked in his doomed head was the secret of the survival of his race.</p>

<p>A howl of despair broke from his throat, and his hands clenched convulsively around the cartilage of the face.</p>

<p>The whale shuddered.</p>

<p>Rees stared unbelieving at his hands. Up to now the whale had shown no more awareness of his presence than would he of an individual microbial parasite. But if his physical actions had not disturbed the whale, perhaps his flood of despair had impacted on that vast, slow brain a few yards away...</p>

<p>And perhaps there was a way out of this.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and conjured up faces. Hollerbach, Jaen, Sheen, Pallis tending his forest; he let the agony of their anticipated deaths, his longing to return to and to save his people flood through him and focus into a single, hard point of pain. He physically hauled at the whale's face, as if by brute force he could drag the great creature from its path into the Core.</p>

<p>A monstrous sadness assailed Rees now, a pleading that this human infection should leave the whale be to follow its herd to safety. Rees felt as if he were drowning in sorrow. He fixed on a single image: the wonder on the face of the young Third, Nead, as he had watched the beauty of the Nebula's rim unfold in the Telescope monitor; and the whale shuddered again, more violently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">11</h3>

<p>The assault of the mine craft on the Raft had been under way for only thirty minutes, but already the air around the Platform was filled with the cries of wounded.</p>

<p>Pallis crawled through the foliage of his tree, working feverishly at the fire bowls. A glance through the leaves showed him that his blanket of smoke was even and thick. The tree rose smoothly; he felt a warming professional satisfaction&mdash;despite the situation.</p>

<p>He raised his head. The dozen trees of his flight were arrayed in a wide, leafy curve which matched the arc of the Raft a hundred yards above: they were just below the Platform, according to his charts of the underside. His trees rose as steadily as if attached by rods of iron; in a few minutes they would sweep over the Raft's horizon.</p>

<p>He could see the nearer pilots as they worked at their fires, their thin faces grim.</p>

<p>"Can't we speed it up?" Nead stood before him, his face stretched with anxiety and tension.</p>

<p>"Keep at your work, lad."</p>

<p>"But can't you hear them?" The young man, blinking away tears, shook a fist toward the thin battle noise drifting down from the Platform.</p>

<p>"Of course I can." Pallis willed the temper to subside from his scarred mask of a face. "But if we go off half-cocked we'll get ourselves killed. Right? On the other hand, if we stick to our formation, our plan, we've a chance of beating the buggers. Think about it, Nead; you used to be a Scientist, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Nead wiped his eyes and nose with the palm of his hand. "Only Third Class."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you've been trained to use your brain. So come on, man; there's a job of work to be done here and I'm relying on you to do it. Now then, I think those bowls near the trunk need restocking..."</p>

<p>Nead returned to work; for a few moments Pallis watched him. Nead's frame was gaunt, his shoulder blades and elbows prominent; his Scientist's coverall had been patched so many times it was barely recognizable as a piece of cloth, let alone a uniform. When his eyes caught Pallis's they were black-ringed.</p>

<p>Nead was barely seventeen thousand shifts old. By the Bones, Pallis thought grimly, what are we doing to our young people?</p>

<p>If only he could believe in his own damn pep talks he might feel better.</p>

<p>The flight swept out of the shadow of the Raft, and leaves blazed golden-brown in the sudden starlight. Pallis could feel the tree's sap churn through its branches; its rotation increased like an eager skitter's and it seemed to leap up at the star which hung in the Raft's sky.</p>

<p>The Rim was mere yards above him now. He felt a growl building in his throat, dark and primeval. He raised a fist above his head; the other pilots waved their arms in silent salute.</p>

<p>...And the line of trees soared over the Platform.</p>

<p>A panorama of blood and flames unfolded before Pallis. People ran everywhere. The deck was crowded with blazing awnings and shelters; where the roofs had been blasted away Pallis could see papers burning in great heaps. The sudden downwash from the trees' branches caused the fires to flicker and belch smoke.</p>

<p>Three mine craft&mdash;iron plates fitted with jets&mdash;hovered a dozen yards above the Platform. Their jets spat live steam; Pallis saw Raft men squirm, the flesh blistering away from incautious limbs. Miners, two or three to a craft, lay belly down on the plates, dropping bottles which bloomed fire like obscene flowers.</p>

<p>This was the worst assault yet. Previously the miners had targeted the sites of the supply machines&mdash;their main objective&mdash;and had largely been beaten off, with low casualties on either side. But this time they were striking at the heart of the Raft's government.</p>

<p>There was little sign of organized defense. Even Pallis's flight had been near the end of its patrol of the underside when the miners attacked; if not for a pilot's sharp eyes the Raft might have been unable to mount any real counter-thrust. But at least the Platform's occupants were fighting back. Spears and knives lanced up at the hovering plate craft, forcing the miners to cower behind their flying shields&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;until, as Pallis watched, one spear looped over a craft and made a lucky strike, driving through a miner's shoulder. The man stared at the bloody tip protruding from his muscle, grabbed it with his good hand, and began to scream.</p>

<p>The craft, undirected, tipped.</p>

<p>The other occupants of the craft called out and tried to reach the controls; but within seconds the plate, swaying, had fallen to within a few feet of the deck. Raft men braved live steam to force their way to the craft; a hundred hands grabbed its rim and the steam jets sputtered and died. The miners were hauled, screaming, from the plate, and were submerged by the flailing arms of the Raft men.</p>

<p>Now the tree flight was perhaps a dozen yards above the Rim and was noticed for the first time by the combatants. A ragged cheer spread through the chaotic ranks of the defenders; the miners turned their heads and their faces went slack. Pallis felt a crude pride as he imagined how this awesome dawn of wood and leaves must look to the simple Belt folk.</p>

<p>Pallis turned to Nead. "Almost time," he murmured. "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Nead stood by the trunk of the tree. He held a bottle of fuel; now he lit the wick with a crude match and held the burning lint before his face. His eyes were deep with hatred. "Oh, I'm ready," he said.</p>

<p>Shame surged through Pallis.</p>

<p>He turned to the battle. "All right, lad," he said briskly. "On my count. Remember, if you can't hit a miner douse your flame; we're not here to bomb our own people." The tree swept over the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e; he saw faces turn up to his shadow like scorched skitter flowers. The nearest plate ship was mere yards away. "Three... two..."</p>

<p>"Pallis!"</p>

<p>Pallis turned sharply. One of the other pilots stood balancing on the trunk of his tree, his hands cupped to his mouth. He turned and pointed skywards. Two more mine craft flew above him, their ragged edges silhouetted against the sky. Squinting, Pallis could make out miners grinning down at him, the glint of glass in their hands; the miners were obviously trying to get above his trees.</p>

<p>"Shit."</p>

<p>"What do we do, Pallis?"</p>

<p>"We've underestimated them. They've caught us out, ambushed us. Damn it. Come on, lad, don't just stand there. We've got to rise before they get above us. You work on the bowls near the rim, and I'll get to the trunk."</p>

<p>Nead stared at the encroaching forms of the miners as if unable to accept this distraction from the simple verities of the battle below.</p>

<p>"Move!" Pallis snapped, thumping his shoulder.</p>

<p>Nead moved.</p>

<p>A floor of smoke spread beneath the trees, spilling over the battlefield. The great wheels lurched up and away from the deck... but the mine craft were smaller, faster and far more maneuverable. Effortlessly they moved into position above the flight.</p>

<p>Pallis felt his shoulders sag. He imagined a fire bomb hitting the dry branches of his tree. The foliage would burn like old paper; the structure would disintegrate and send blazing fragments raining over the deck&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, he wasn't dead yet. "Scatter!" he yelled to his pilots. "They can't take us all."</p>

<p>The formation broke with what seemed ponderous slowness. The two mine craft split up, each making for a tree...</p>

<p>And one of them was Pallis's.</p>

<p>As the plate descended the tree-pilot's eyes met those of the miner above him. Nead came to stand close by the pilot. Pallis reached out, found Nead's shoulder, squeezed hard&mdash;</p>

<p>Then a cold breeze shook the tree and a shadow swept across his face, shocking and unexpected. A huge form sailed across the face of the star above the Raft.</p>

<p>"A whale..." Pallis felt his jaw drop. The great beast was no more than a hundred yards above the deck of the Raft; never in his life had he known a whale to come so close.</p>

<p>When the miners attacking Pallis saw the great, translucent ceiling mere yards above them they called out in panic and jerked at their controls. The plate wobbled, spun about, then shot away.</p>

<p>Bewildered, Pallis turned to survey the Platform battle. The whale's cloudy shadow swept across tiny, struggling humans. Men dropped their weapons and fled. The remaining miners' craft squirted into the air and sailed over the lip of the Raft.</p>

<p>Save for the dead and wounded, the Platform was soon deserted. Fires flickered desultorily from a dozen piles of wreckage.</p>

<p>Nead was sobbing. "It's over, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The invasion? Yes, lad; it's over. For now, at any rate... Thanks to that miracle." He stared up at the whale, imagining the confusion it must be causing as people looked up from the Raft's avenues and factories at this monster in the sky. "But the miners will be back. Or maybe," he added grimly, "we'll be forced to go to meet them..."</p>

the lot of those left behind still further.</p>

<p>"If this mission does not have a reasonable chance of success then I won't back it. It's as simple as that. I won't shorten the lives of the bulk of those I'm responsible for, solely to give a few heroes a pleasure ride."</p>

<p>"You know," Hollerbach said thoughtfully, "I doubt that when you&mdash;ah, acquired&mdash;power on this Raft you imagined having to face decisions like this."</p>

<p>Decker scowled. "Are you mocking me, Scientist?"</p>

<p>Hollerbach closed his eyes. "No."</p>

<p>"Let's think it through," Rees said. "Hollerbach, we need to transport a genetic pool large enough to sustain the race. How many people?"</p>

<p>Hollerbach shrugged. "Four or five hundred?"</p>

<p>"Can we accommodate so many?"</p>

<p>Hollerbach paused before answering. "Yes," he said slowly. "But it will take careful management. Strict planning, rationing... It will be no pleasure ride."</p>

<p>Decker growled, "Genetic pool? Your five hundred will arrive like babies in the new world, without resources. Before they breed they will have to find a way of not falling into the Core of the new nebula."</p>

<p>Rees nodded. "Yes. But so did the Crew of the original Ship. Our migrants will be worse off materially... but at least they will know what to expect."</p>

<p>Decker drove his fist into his thigh. "So you're telling me that the mission can succeed, that a new colony could survive? Hollerbach, you agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Hollerbach said quietly. "We have to work out the details. But&mdash;yes. You have my assurance."</p>

<p>Decker closed his eyes and his great shoulders slumped. "All right. We must continue with your scheme. And this time, try to foresee the problems."</p>

<p>Rees felt a vast relief. If Decker had decided otherwise&mdash;if the great goal had been taken away&mdash;how would he, Rees, have whiled away the rest of his life?</p>

<p>He shuddered. It was unimaginable.</p>

<p>"Now we face further actions," Hollerbach said. He held up his skeletal hand and counted points on his fingers. "Obviously we must continue our studies on the mission itself&mdash;the equipage, separation, guidance of the Bridge. For those left behind, we have to think about moving the Raft."</p>

<p>Decker looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Decker, that star up there isn't going to go away. We'd have shifted out from under it long ago, in normal times. Now that the Raft is fated to stay in this Nebula, we must move it. And finally..." Hollerbach's voice tailed away.</p>

<p>"And finally," Decker said bitterly, "we have to think about how to select those who travel on the Bridge. And those who stay behind."</p>

<p>Rees said, "Perhaps some kind of ballot would be fair..."</p>

<p>Decker shook his head. "No. This jaunt will only succeed if you have the right people."</p>

<p>Hollerbach nodded. "You're right, of course."</p>

<p>Rees frowned. "...I guess so. But&mdash;who selects the 'right' crew?"</p>

<p>Decker glared at him, the scars on his face deepening into a mask of pain. "Who do you think?"</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>Rees cradled his drink globe. "So that's it," he told Pallis. "Now Decker faces the decision of his life."</p>

<p>Pallis stood before his cage of young trees, poked at the wooden bars. Some of the trees were almost old enough to release, he reflected absently. "Power brings responsibility, it seems. I'm not certain Decker understood that when he emerged on top from that joke Committee. But he sure understands it now... Decker will make the right decision; let's hope the rest of us do the same."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, the rest of us?"</p>

<p>Pallis lifted the cage from its stand; it was light, if bulky, and he held it out to Rees. The young Scientist put down his drink globe and took the cage uncertainly, staring at the agitated young trees. "This should go on the journey," Pallis said. "Maybe you should take more. Release them into the new nebula, let them breed&mdash;and, in a few hundred shifts, whole new forests will begin to form. If the new place doesn't have its own already..."</p>

<p>"Why are you giving this to me? I don't understand, tree-pilot."</p>

<p>"But I do," Sheen said.</p>

<p>Pallis whirled. Rees gasped, juggling the cage in his shock.</p>

<p>She stood just inside the doorway, diffuse starlight catching the fine hairs on her bare arms.</p>

<p>Pallis, with hot shame, felt himself blush; seeing her standing there, in his own cabin, made him feel like a clumsy adolescent. "I wasn't expecting you," he said lamely.</p>

<p>She laughed. "I can see that. Well, am I not to be invited in? Can't I have a drink?"</p>

<p>"Of course..."</p>

<p>Sheen settled comfortably to the floor, crossing her legs under her. She nodded to Rees.</p>

<p>Rees looked from Pallis to Sheen and back, his color deepening. Pallis was surprised. Did Rees have some feeling for his former supervisor... even after his treatment during his return exile on the Belt? Rees stood up, awkwardly fumbling with the cage. "I'll talk to you again, Pallis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't have to go," Pallis said quickly.</p>

<p>Sheen's eyes sparkled with amusement.</p>

<p>Again Rees looked from one to the other. "I guess it would be for the best," he said. With mumbled farewells, he left.</p>

<p>Pallis handed Sheen a drink globe. "So he's carrying a torch for you."</p>

<p>"Adolescent lust," she said starkly.</p>

<p>Pallis grinned. "I can understand that. But Rees is no adolescent."</p>

<p>"I know that. He's become determined, and he's driving us all ahead of him. He's the savior of the world. But he's also a bloody idiot when he wants to be."</p>

<p>"I think he's jealous..."</p>

<p>"Is there something for him to be jealous of, tree-pilot?"</p>

<p>Pallis dropped his eyes without reply.</p>

<p>"So," she said briskly, "you're not travelling on the Bridge. That was the meaning of your gift to Rees, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He nodded, turning to the space the cage had occupied.</p>

<p>"There's not much of my life left," he said slowly. "My place on that Bridge would be better to go to some youngster."</p>

<p>She reached forward and touched his knee; the feeling of her flesh was electric. "They'll only invite you to go if they think they need you."</p>

<p>He snorted. "Sheen, by the time those caged skitters have grown, my stiffening corpse will long since have been hurled over the Rim. And what use will I be without a tree to fly?" He pointed to the flying forest hidden by the cabin's roof. "My life is the forest up there. After the Bridge goes, the Raft will still be here, for a long time to come. And they're going to need their trees."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Well, I understand, even if I don't agree." She fixed him with her clear eyes. "I guess we can debate it after the Bridge has gone."</p>

<p>He gasped; then he reached out and took her hand. "What are you talking about? Surely you're not planning to stay too? Sheen, you're crazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tree-pilot," she snapped, "I did not insult you on the quality of your decision." She let her hand rest in his. "As you said, the Raft is going to be here for a long time to come. And so is the Belt. It's going to be grim after the Bridge departs, taking away&mdash;all our hope. But someone will have to keep things turning. Someone will have to call the shift changes. And, like you, I find I don't want to leave behind my life."</p>

<p>He nodded. "Well, I won't say I agree&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said warningly, "Tree-pilot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I respect your decision. And&mdash;" He felt the heat rise to his face again. "And I'm glad you'll still be here."</p>

<p>She smiled and moved her face closer to his. "What are you trying to say, tree-pilot?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we can keep each other company."</p>

<p>She reached up, took a curl of his beard, and tugged it gently. "Yes. Maybe we can."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">14</h3>

<p>A cage of scaffolding obscured the Bridge's clean lines. Crew members crawled over the scaffolding fixing steam jets to the Bridge's hull. Rees, with Hollerbach and Grye, walked around the perimeter of the work area. Rees eyed the project with a critical eye. "We're too slow, damn it."</p>

<p>Grye twisted his hands together. "Rees, I'm forced to say that your detailed understanding of this project is woefully lacking. Come&mdash;" He beckoned. "Let me show you how much progress we have made." He slapped a plump hand against the wooden cage surrounding the Bridge; it was a rectangular box securely fastened to the deck, and it supported three broad hoops which wrapped around the Bridge itself. "We can't take chances with this," Grye said. "The last stage in the launch process will be the cutting away of the Bridge from the deck. When that is done, all that will support the Bridge will be this scaffolding. A mistake made here could cause catastrophic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Rees said, irritated. "But the fact is we're running out of time..."</p>

<p>They came to the Bridge's open port. Under the supervision of Jaen and another Scientist, two burly workmen were manhandling an instrument out of the Observatory. The instrument&mdash;a mass spectrometer, Rees recognized&mdash;was dented and scratched, and its power lead terminated in a melted stump. The spectrometer was placed with several others in an eerie group some yards from the Bridge; the discarded instruments turned blinded sensors to the sky.</p>

<p>Hollerbach shuddered. "And this is something I certainly hesitate over," he said, his voice strained. "We face an awful dilemma. Every instrument we vandalize and throw out gives us floor space and air for another four or five people. But can we afford to leave behind this telescope, that spectrometer? Is this device a mere luxury&mdash;or, in the unknown environs of our destination, will we leave ourselves blind in some key spectrum?"</p>

<p>Rees suppressed a sigh. Hesitation, delays, obfuscations, more delays... Obviously the Scientists could not metamorphose into men of action in mere hours&mdash;and he sympathized with the dilemmas they were trying to resolve&mdash;but he wished they could learn to establish and stick to priorities.</p>

<p>Now they came to a group of Scientists probing cautiously at a food machine. The huge device loomed over them, its outlets like stilled mouths. Rees knew that the machine was too large to carry into the Bridge's interior, and so it&mdash;and a second companion machine&mdash;would, rather absurdly, have to be lodged close to the port in the Bridge's outer corridor.</p>

<p>Grye and Hollerbach both made to speak, but Rees held up his hands. "No," he said acidly. "Let me go into the reasons why we can't possibly rush this particular process. We've calculated that if strict rationing is imposed during the flight two machines should satisfy our needs. This one even has an air filtration and oxygenation unit built into it, we've discovered..."</p>

<p>"Yes," Grye said eagerly, "but that calculation depends on a key assumption: that the machines will work at full efficiency inside the Bridge. And we don't know enough about their power supply to be sure. We know this machine's power source is built into it somehow&mdash;unlike the Bridge instruments, which shared a single unit by way of cables&mdash;and we even suspect, from the old manuals, that it's based on a microscopic black hole&mdash;but we're not sure. What if it requires starlight as a source of replenishment? What if it produces volumes of some noxious gas which, in the confines of the Bridge, will suffocate us all?"</p>

<p>Rees said, "We have to test and be sure, I accept that. If the efficiency of the machine goes down by just ten per cent&mdash;then that's fifty more people we have to leave behind."</p>

<p>Grye nodded. "Then you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see that these decisions take time. But time is what we just don't have, damn it..." Pressure built inside him: a pressure which, he knew, would not be relieved until, for better or worse, the Bridge was launched.</p>

<p>Walking on, they met Gord. The mine engineer and Nead, who was working as his assistant, were carrying a steam jet unit to the Bridge. Gord nodded briskly. "Gentlemen."</p>

<p>Rees studied the little mine engineer, his worries momentarily lifting. Gord had returned to his old efficient, bustling, slightly prickly self; he was barely recognizable as the shadow Rees had found on the Boneys' worldlet. "You're doing well, Gord."</p>

<p>Gord scratched his bald pate. "We're progessing," he said lightly. "I'll say no more than that; but, yes, we're progressing."</p>

<p>Hollerbach leaned forward, hands folded behind his back. "What about this control system problem?"</p>

<p>Gord nodded cautiously. "Rees, are you up to date on this one? To direct the Bridge's fall&mdash;to change its orbit&mdash;we need some way to control the steam jets we'll have fixed to the hull; but we don't want to make any breaches in the hull through which to pass our control lines. We don't even know if we can make breaches, come to that.</p>

<p>"Now it looks as if we can use components from the cannibalized Moles. Some of their motor units operate on an action-at-a-distance principle. I'm just a simple engineer; maybe you Scientists understand the ins and outs of it. But what it boils down to is that we may be able to operate the jets from inside the Bridge with a series of switches which won't need any physical connection to the jets at all. We're about to run tests on the extent to which the hull material blocks the signals."</p>

<p>Hollerbach smiled. "I'm impressed. Was this your idea?"</p>

<p>"Ah..." Gord scratched his cheek. "We did get a little guidance from a Mole brain. Once you ask the right questions&mdash;and get past its complaints about 'massive sensor dysfunction'&mdash;it's surprising how..." His voice tailed away and his eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Rees." The vast voice came from behind Rees; the Scientist stiffened. "I thought I'd find you hanging around here."</p>

<p>Rees turned and lifted his face up to Roch's. The huge miner's eyes were, as ever, red-rimmed with inchoate anger; his fists opened and closed like pistons. Grye whimpered softly and edged behind Hollerbach. "I have work to do, Roch," Rees said calmly. "So must you; I suggest you return to it."</p>

<p>"Work?" Roch's filth-rimmed nostrils flared and he waved a fist at the Bridge. "Like hell will I work so you and your pox-ridden friends can fly off in this fancy thing."</p>

<p>Hollerbach said sternly, "Sir, the lists of passengers have not yet been published; and until they are it is up to all of us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They don't need to be published. We all know who'll be on that trip... and it won't be the likes of me. Rees, I should have sucked your brains out of your skull while I had the chance down on the kernel." Roch held up a rope-like finger. "I'll be back," he growled. "And when I find I'm not on that list I'm going to make damn sure you're not either." He stabbed the finger at Grye. "And the same goes for you!"</p>

<p>Grye turned ash white and trembled convulsively.</p>

<p>Roch stalked off. Gord hefted his jet and said wryly, "Good to know that in this time of upheaval some things have stayed exactly the same. Come on, Nead; let's get this thing mounted."</p>

<p>Rees faced Hollerbach and Grye. He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder toward the departed Roch. "That's why we are running out of time," he said. "The political situation on this Raft&mdash;no, damn it, the human situation&mdash;is deteriorating fast. The whole thing is unstable. Everyone knows that a 'list' is being drawn up... and most people have a good idea who'll be on it. How long can we expect people to work toward a goal most of them cannot share? A second uprising would be catastrophic. We would descend into anarchy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hollerbach emitted a sigh; suddenly he seemed to stagger. Grye took his arm. "Chief Scientist&mdash;are you all right?"</p>

<p>Hollerbach fixed rheumy eyes on Rees. "I'm tired, you see... terribly tired. You're right, of course, Rees, but what can any of us do, other than give our best efforts to this goal?"</p>

<p>Rees realized suddenly that he had been unloading his own doubts onto the weakening shoulders of Hollerbach, as if he were still a child and the old man some kind of impregnable adult. "I'm sorry," he said. "I shouldn't burden you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hollerbach waved a shaky hand. "No, no; you're quite right. In a way it helps clarify my own thinking." His eyes twinkled with a faint amusement. "Even your friend Roch helps, in a way. Look at the comparison between us. Roch is young, powerful; I'm too old to stand up&mdash;let alone to pass on my frailties to a new generation. Which of us should go on the mission?"</p>

<p>Rees was appalled. "Hollerbach, we need your understanding. You're not suggesting..."</p>

<p>"Rees, I suspect a grave flaw in the way we live our lives here has been our refusal to accept our place in the universe. We inhabit a world which places a premium on physical strength and endurance&mdash;as your friend Roch so ably demonstrates&mdash;and on agility, reflex and adaptabilty&mdash;for example, the Boneys&mdash;rather than 'understanding.' We are little more than clumsy animals lost in this bottomless sky. But our inheritance of ageing gadgetry from the Ship, the supply machines and the rest, has let us maintain the illusion that we are masters of this universe, as perhaps we were masters of the world man came from.</p>

<p>"Now, this enforced migration is going to force us to abandon most of our cherished toys&mdash;and with them our illusions." He looked vaguely into the distance. "Perhaps, looking far into man's future, our big brains will atrophy, useless; perhaps we will become one with the whales and sky wolves, surviving as best we can among the flying trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rees snorted. "Hollerbach, you're turning into a maundering bugger in your old age."</p>

<p>Hollerbach raised his eyebrows. "Boy, I was cultivating old age while you were still chewing iron ore on the kernel of a star."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about the far future, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. All I can do is solve the problems of the present. And frankly, Hollerbach, I don't believe we've a hope of surviving this trip without your guidance.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we've a lot to do. I suggest we get on with it."</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>The plate hung over the Raft. Pallis crept to its edge and peered out over the battered deckscape.</p>

<p>Smoke was spreading across the deck like a mask over a familiar face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the plate jerked through the air, bowling Pallis onto his back. With a growl he reached out and grabbed handfuls of the netting that swathed the fragile craft. "By the Bones, innkeeper, can't you control this bloody thing?"</p>

<p>Jame snorted. "This is a real ship. You're not dangling from one of your wooden toys now, tree-pilot."</p>

<p>"Don't push your luck, mine rat." Pallis thumped a fist into the rough iron of the plate. "It's just that this way of flying is&mdash;unnatural."</p>

<p>"Unnatural?" Jame laughed. "Maybe you're right. And maybe you people spent too much time lying around in your leafy bowers, while the miners came along to piss all over you."</p>

<p>"The war is over, Jame," Pallis said easily. He let his shoulders hang loose, rolled his hands into half fists. "But perhaps there are one or two loose ends to be tied up."</p>

<p>The barman's broad face twisted into a grin of anticipation. "I'd like nothing better, tree swinger. Name the time and place, and choice of weapons."</p>

<p>"Oh, no weapons."</p>

<p>"That will suit me fine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the Bones, will you two shut up?" Nead, the plate's third occupant, glared over the charts and instruments spread over his lap. "We have work to do, if you recall."</p>

<p>Jame and Pallis exchanged one last stare, then Jame returned his attention to the controls of the craft. Pallis shifted across the little deck until he sat beside Nead. "Sorry," he said gruffly. "How's it going?"</p>

<p>Nead held a battered sextant to his eye, then tried to compare the reading to entries in a handwritten table. "Damn it," he said, clearly frustrated. "I can't tell. I just don't have the expertise, Pallis. Cipse would know. If only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If only he weren't long dead, then everything would be fine," Pallis said. "I know. Just do your best, lad. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Again Nead ran his fingers over the tables. "I think it's taking too long. I'm trying to measure the sideways speed of the Raft against the background stars, and I don't think it's moving fast enough."</p>

<p>Pallis frowned. He lay on his belly and once more surveyed the Raft. The mighty old craft lay spread out below him like a tray of fantastic toys. Suspended over the deck and marked by the occasional plume of steam he could see other plate craft, more observers of this huge dislocation. A wall of smoke climbed up from one side of the Rim&mdash;the port side, as he looked down&mdash;and, additionally, each of the trees in the central tethered forest had its own smoke cloak. The smoke was having the desired effect&mdash;he could see how the trees' cables leaned consistently to his right as the flying plants sought to escape the shadow of the smoke&mdash;and he imagined he could hear the strain of the cables as the Raft was hauled aside. Cable shadows were beginning to lengthen over the deck; the Raft was indeed moving out from under the star which hung poised over it. It was an inspiring sight, one which Pallis in his long life had seen only twice previously; and for such cooperation to be achieved after the turmoil of revolution and war&mdash;and at a time when so many of the Raft's best were occupied with the Bridge project&mdash;was, he decided, something to be admired.</p>

<p>In fact, perhaps the need to move the Raft had provided the glue which had held society together this far. Here was a project which would clearly benefit all.</p>

<p>Yes, it was all admirable&mdash;but if it was too slow it wouldn't mean a damn thing. The falling star was still miles overhead, and there was no immediate danger of impact, but if pressure was maintained on the trees for too long the great plants would tire. Not only would they prove unable to drag the Raft anywhere&mdash;it was even conceivable that some might fail altogether, threatening the Raft's security in the air.</p>

<p>Damn it. He hung his head over the lip of the plate, trying to judge where the problem lay. The Rim wall of smoke looked solid enough; the distant stars cast a long shadow over the masked workers who labored at the base of the cliff of smoke.</p>

<p>Then the problem must be with the tethered trees themselves. There was a pilot, plus assistants, in each tree, and each of them was trying to maintain his own fence of smoke. Those small barriers were probably the most significant factor in influencing the movement of the individual trees. And, even from up here, Pallis could see how ragged and insubstantial some of those barriers were.</p>

<p>He thumped his fist into the deck of the craft. Damn it; the purges of the revolution, and the fevers and starvation that had followed, had left his corps of pilots as depleted of skilled people as most other sectors of Raft society. He remembered Raft translations of the past: the endless calculations, the shift-long briefings, the motion of the trees like components of a fine machine...</p>

<p>There had been time for none of that. Some of the newer pilots barely had the skill to keep from falling out of their trees. And building a lateral wall was one of the most difficult of a pilot's arts; it was like sculpting with smoke...</p>

<p>He spotted a group of trees whose barriers were particularly ragged. He pointed them out to Jame.</p>

<p>The barman grinned and yanked at his control cables.</p>

<p>Pallis tried to ignore the gale in his face, the stink of steam; he put aside his nostalgia for the stately grandeur of the trees. Beside him he heard Nead curse as his papers were blown like leaves. The plate swooped among the trees like some huge, unlikely skitter; Pallis couldn't help but flinch as branches shot past, mere feet from his face. At last the craft came to rest. From here those smoke barriers looked even more tenuous; Pallis watched, despairing, as raw pilots waved blankets at wisps of smoke.</p>

<p>He cupped his hands to his mouth. "You!"</p>

<p>Small faces turned up to him. One pilot tumbled backwards.</p>

<p>"Build up your bowls!" Pallis called angrily. "Get a decent amount of smoke. All you're doing with those damn blankets is blowing around two fifths of five per cent of bugger all..."</p>

<p>The pilots inched their way to their bowls and began feeding fresh kindling to the tiny flames.</p>

<p>Nead tugged at Pallis's sleeve. "Pilot. Should that be happening?"</p>

<p>Pallis looked. Two trees, wrapped in distorted blankets of smoke, were inclining blindly towards one another, their amateur pilots evidently absorbed in the minutiae of blankets and bowls.</p>

<p>"No, it bloody shouldn't be happening." Pallis spat. "Barman! Get us down there, and fast&mdash;"</p>

<p>The trees' first touch was almost tender: a rustle of foliage, a gentle kiss of snapping twigs. Then the first snag occurred, and the two platforms locked and shuddered. The crews of the trees gaped with sudden horror at each other.</p>

<p>The trees kept turning; now sections of rim were torn away and wooden shards rained through the air. A branch caught and with a scream like some animal's was torn away by the root. Now the trees began to roll into each other, in a vast, slow, noisy collision. The smooth platforms of foliage shattered. Fist-sized splinters sailed past the plate craft; Nead howled and covered his head.</p>

<p>Pallis glared down at the crews of the dying trees. "Get off there! The damn trees are finished. Get down your cables and save yourselves."</p>

<p>They stared up at him, frightened and confused. Pallis shouted on until at last he saw them slide down rippling cables to the deck.</p>

<p>The trees were now locked in a doomed embrace, their angular momenta mingling, their trunks orbiting in a whirl of foliage and branch stumps. Wall-sized sections of wood splintered away and the air was filled with the creak of rending timber; Pallis saw fire bowls go sailing through the air, and he prayed that the crews had had the foresight to douse their flames.</p>

<p>Soon little was left but the trunks, locked together by a tangle of twisted branches; now the trees' anchoring cables were torn loose like shoulders from sockets, and the freed trunks pirouetted with a strange grace, half tumbling.</p>

<p>At last the trunks crashed to the deck, exploding in a storm of fragments. Pallis saw men running for their lives from the rain of wood. For some minutes splinters fell, like a hail of ragged daggers; then, slowly, men began to creep back to the crash site, stepping over tree cables which lay like the limbs of a corpse among the ruins.</p>

<p>Silently Pallis motioned to Jame. "There's nothing we can do here; let's get on." The plate craft lifted and returned to its patrols.</p>

<p>For several more hours Pallis's plate skimmed about the flying forest. At the end of it Jame was muttering angrily, his face blackened by the rising smoke, and Pallis's throat was raw with shouting. At last Nead placed his sextant in his lap and sat back with a smile. "That's it," he said. "I think, anyway..."</p>

<p>"What's what?" Jame growled. "Is the Raft out from under the bloody star now?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet. But it's got enough momentum without further impulse from the trees. In a few hours it will drift to a halt far enough from the path of the star to be safe."</p>

<p>Pallis lay back in the netting of the plate and took a draught from a drink globe. "So we've made it."</p>

<p>Nead said dreamily, "It's not quite over for the Raft yet. When the star passes through the plane in which the Raft lies there will be a few interesting tidal effects."</p>

<p>Pallis shrugged. "Nothing the Raft hasn't endured before."</p>

<p>"It must be a fantastic sight, Pallis."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," the pilot mused. He remembered watching cable shadows lengthen across the deck; at last the circumference of the star disc would touch the horizon, sending light flaring across the deck. And when the main disc had dropped below the Rim there would be an afterglow, what the Scientists call a corona...</p>

<p>Jame squinted into the sky. "How often does this happen, then? How often does the Raft get in the way of a falling star?"</p>

<p>Pallis shrugged. "Not often. Once or twice a generation. Often enough for us to have built up skills to deal with it."</p>

<p>"But you need the Scientists&mdash;the likes of this one&mdash;" Jame jerked a thumb at Nead "&mdash;to work out what to do."</p>

<p>"Well, of course." Nead sounded amused. "You can't do these things by sticking a wet finger into the wind."</p>

<p>"But a lot of the Scientists are going to bugger off, on this Bridge thing."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"So what's going to happen when the next star comes down? How will they move the Raft then?"</p>

<p>Nead sipped a drink easily. "Well, our observations show that the next star&mdash;a long way up there&mdash;" he pointed upwards "&mdash;is many thousands of shifts away from endangering the Raft."</p>

<p>Pallis frowned. "That doesn't answer Jame's question."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does." Nead's blank young face bore a look of puzzlement. "You see, by that time we don't expect the Nebula to be sustaining life anyway. So the problem's rather academic, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Pallis and Jame exchanged glances; then Pallis turned to the rotating forest under his craft and tried to lose himself in contemplation of its steady serenity.</p>

<h3 align="center">* * *</h3>

<p>Rees hardly slept during his last rest period before the Bridge's departure.</p>

<p>A bell tolled somewhere.</p>

<p>At last it was time. Rees rose from his pallet, washed quickly, and emerged from his temporary shelter, feeling only a vast relief that the time had come.</p>

<p>The Bridge in its box of scaffolding was the center of frantic activity. It lay at the heart of a fenced-off area two hundred yards wide which had become a miniature city; former Officers' quarters had been commandeered to give hopeful migrants temporary accommodation. Now small knots of people walked uncertainly toward the Bridge. Rees recognized representatives of all the Nebula's cultures: the Raft itself, the Belt, and even a few Boneys. Each refugee carried the few pounds of personal belongings allowed. A queue was forming at the open port of the Bridge, behind a human chain which passed into the interior a few final supplies, books, small environmental monitoring instruments. There was an air of purposefulness about the scene and Rees slowly began to believe that this thing was actually going to happen...</p>

<p>Whatever the future held he could only be glad that this period of waiting, with all its divisiveness and bitterness, was over. After the moving of the Raft, society had disintegrated rapidly. It had been a race to complete their preparations before things fell apart completely; and as time had passed&mdash;and more delays and problems had been encountered&mdash;Rees had felt the pressure build until it seemed he could hardly bear it.</p>

<p>The amount of personal animosity he had encountered had astonished him. He longed to explain to people that it was not he who was causing the Nebula to fail; that it was not he who decreed the physical laws which constrained the number of evacuees.</p>

<p>...And it had not been he&mdash;alone&mdash;who had drawn up the list.</p>

<p>The preparation of that list had been agonizing. The idea of a ballot had been rejected quickly; the composition of this colony could not be left to chance. But how to select humans&mdash;families, chains of descendants&mdash;for life or extinction? They had tried to be scientific, and so had applied criteria like physical fitness, intelligence, adaptability, breeding age...
