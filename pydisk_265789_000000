<h2 class="chapter">12 SHE WHO WILL NOT WAIT</h2>

<p>THE ROOM was low and long, dark save where the shutters were well open to the call of the sea, the light
which came over those restless waves. And the woman
who sat by the table was as turbulent within as those
waves, though she showed little outward sign of her concern. She
wore leather and mail; the chain-mail-scarfed helm, winged like
that of any Borderer, sat on the table board to her right hand. And
at her left was a tall cage in which perched a white falcon as
silent and yet as aware as she. Between her fingers a small roll of
bark rolled back and forth.</p>

<p>One of the witches? The captain of the Sulcar cruiser was still
trying to assess her as he came from the door to front her. He had
been summoned from the dockside to this tavern by one of the
Borderers, for what reason he could not guess.</p>

<p>But when the woman looked at him, he thought that this was no
witch. He did not see her gem of power. Only, neither was she any
common dame. He sketched a half salute as he would have to any of
his fellow captains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Koityi Stymir, at your summoning, Wise One.&rdquo;
Deliberately he used the witch address to see her reaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am Jaelithe Tregarth,&rdquo; she replied
without
amplification. &ldquo;They tell me, Captain, that you are
about to put to sea on patrol&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raiding,&rdquo; he corrected her, &ldquo;up Alizon
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The falcon shifted on its cage perch, its very bright eyes on
the man. He had an odd feeling that it was as intelligently
interested in his answer as the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raiding,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I come to offer you
something other than a raid, Captain. Although it may not put loot
into your empty hold and it may bring you far greater danger than
any Alizon sword or dart you may face in the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaelithe studied the seafarer. As all his race he was
tall, wide of shoulder, fair of hair. Young as he was,
there was a self-confidence in his carriage which spoke
of past success and a belief in the future. She had not
had time to choose widely, but what she had heard
of Stymir along the waterfront made her send for him
out of all the captains now in port at the mouth of the River
Es.</p>

<p>There was this about the Sulcar breed: adventure and daring had
a pull on them, sometimes over that of certain gain in trade, loot
in war. It was that strain in their character which made them
explorers as well as merchant traders in far seas. And she must
depend upon that quality now to attract Stymir to her service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you have to offer me, lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A
chance to find the Kolder base,&rdquo; she told him boldly. This
was no time to fence. Time&mdash;that inner turmoil boiled in her
until she could hardly control it&mdash;time was her slave driver
in this venture.</p>

<p>For a long moment he stared at her and then he spoke: &ldquo;For
years have we sought that, lady. How comes it now into your hands
that you can speak so, as if you held a map to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no map, but still a method to find it&mdash;or
believe that this is possible. But time grows short, and this
depends upon time.&rdquo; And distance? her mind questioned. Could
Simon get beyond the reach of their tie and she lose contact with
him?</p>

<p>She twisted the roll of bark which had come out of Tormarsh,
which had been an argument with the Guardians.</p>

<p>Her inner conflict might have been communicated to the great
falcon, for now it mantled and screamed, even as it might scream in
battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You believe in what you say, lady,&rdquo; Stymir
conceded. &ldquo;The Kolder base&mdash;&rdquo; With his finger tip
he traced a design on the table board between them. &ldquo;The
Kolder base!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he raised his eyes again to meet hers there was a
wariness in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are tales among us&mdash;that the Kolder have a way
of distorting minds and so sending those who were once our friends,
even our cup-comrades, to lead us into their traps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaelithe nodded. &ldquo;That is indeed the truth, Captain, and
you do well to think about such a risk. But, I am of the Old Race,
and I have been a witch. You know that the Kolder taint cannot
touch any of my kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have been a witch&mdash;&rdquo; He caught and held to
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why am I not one now?&rdquo; She brought herself to
answer that, though the need for doing so rasped her raw.
&ldquo;Because I am now wife to him who is March Warder of Estcarp.
Have you not heard of the outlander who helped lead the storming
of Sippar&mdash;Simon Tregarth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; There was wonder in the captain now.
&ldquo;Aye, we have heard of him. Then you, lady, rode to
Sulcarkeep for its last battle. Aye, you have met Kolder and you
know Kolder! Tell me what you now devise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaelithe began her tale, the one she had set in mind before this
meeting. When she had done the captain&rsquo;s amazement was
marked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you think this we can do, lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go myself to its doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To find the Kolder base&mdash;to lead in a fleet upon the
finding. Aye, such a feat as that the bards would sing for a
hundred hundred years to come! This is a mighty business, lady. But
where is the fleet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fleet follows, but only one ship may lead. We do not
know what devices these Kolder have in their below-water ship, how
well they may be able to track anything on the surface. One ship
above, not too close&mdash;that they might not suspect. A fleet
could have but one meaning for them, and then, would they
knowingly lead us to their den?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Stymir nodded. &ldquo;Clearly thought, my lady.
So then how do we bring in the fleet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaelithe lifted her hand to the cage. &ldquo;Thus. This one
has been trained by the Falconers to return whence
it came, bearing any message. I have already conferred with those in authority. The fleet will assemble,
cruise out to sea. When the message comes, why&mdash;then
they will move in. But this is a matter of time. If the
under-seas ship issues from the marsh river and has too
great a lead, then I am not sure we can contact my lord, captive in
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This river, draining from Tormarsh . . .&rdquo; It was
plain that the captain was trying to align points along the shore
to make a picture he knew. &ldquo;I would guess it to be the
Enkere&mdash;to the north. We could pose as a raider on the course
to Alizon and so reach that spot without raising any undue
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may we sail soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if you wish, lady. The supplies are aboard, the crew
gathered. We were off to Alizon today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This voyage may be longer; your supplies for coast
raiding are limited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True. But there is the <em>Sword Bride</em> in from the south; she
carries supplies for the army. We may trans-ship from her if you
have the authority. And that will take but a small measure of
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the authority. Let us be about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Guardians might not believe that she would retain this
power of hers, but they had granted her backing for now. Jaelithe
frowned. To have to use one of the Seakeep witches to transmit that
request and her message had been galling, but she was willing to
face any rebuff to gain her ends. And she had proved, when she had
used the falcon and her new perception to confuse Simon in the
flyer, that she did have something they could not dismiss as
useless. Kolder would only die when its heart was blasted. And if
she and Simon, working together, could find that heart, then all
witchdom would back them to the limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Captain Stymir was as good as his boast. It still lacked
several hours of nightfall when his <em>Wave Cleaver</em>
skimmed out of the harbor, heading towards the black
blot of Gorm and so beyond for the open sea. She had
chosen better than she knew, Jaelithe decided, when
she had picked Stymir from the four captains in the
harbor. His ship was small, but she was swift, a cruiser rather
than one of the wider-bottomed merchant carriers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been an opener of ways, Captain?&rdquo; she
asked as they stood together by the great rudder sweep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, lady. It was my thought to try for the far north&mdash;had
this war with Kolder not broken on our heads. There is a village I have visited&mdash;odd people, small,
dark, with a click-click speech of their own we cannot
rightly twist tongue around. But they offer such furs as
I have seen nowhere else&mdash;only a few of them. Silver
those furs, long of hair, but very soft. When we asked
whence they came, this click-click speech folk said that
they are brought once a year by a caravan of wild
men from the north. They have other wares, too. Look
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slipped from his wrist a band of metal and offered it to
her. Jaelithe turned the ring about in her fingers. Gold, but a
paler gold than she had ever seen before. Old, very old, and there
was a design, so worn that it was merely curves and hollows. Yet
there was sophistication, a degree of art in that worn design which
did not say primitive but hinted of civilization&mdash;only what
civilization?</p>

<p>&ldquo;This I traded for two years ago in that village, and
all they could tell me was that it came from the north
with the wild men. Look you, here and here.&rdquo; He
touched with finger tip two points on the band, &ldquo;That
is a star&mdash;very much worn away and yet a star. And on
the very, very old things of my people there are sometimes such stars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another trader of your people ages ago who made a voyage
there and returned not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But there is also another thought. For we have
bard songs, also very old, of whence we first came&mdash;and that
there was cold and snow, and much battling with monsters of the
dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaelithe thought of how Simon had come to Estcarp, and of that gate in another place through which the Kolder had
issued to trouble them. These Sulcarmen, always restless, ever at
sea, taking their families with them on such voyages as if they
might not return. Only in the times of outright war were Sulcar
ships other than floating villages. Had they, too, come through a
gate which kept them searching with some hidden instinct to find
again? She gave the band back to Stymir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quest of value, Captain. May there be long years for
each of us for the questing we hold in our hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, lady. Now we are approaching the mouth of
the Enkere. Do you wish to hunt in your own way for the Kolder
water sulker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She lay on the bunk in the small cabin to which the captain had
shown her. It was hot and close and the mail shirt constricted her
breathing. But Jaelithe strove to set aside all outward things, to
build in her mind the picture of Simon. There were many Simons and
all had depth of meaning for her, but it was necessary to forge
those into one upon which to center her call.</p>

<p>But&mdash;no answer . . . She had been so sure of instant
contact that that silence was like an unexpected blow. Jaelithe
opened her eyes and gazed up at the roofing of the ship&rsquo;s
timbers so close above her head. The <em>Wave Cleaver</em> was truly
cleaving waves and the motion about her&mdash;perhaps that was what
broke the contact or kept her from completing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon!&rdquo; Her call searched, demanded. She had had
long years of training as a witch, to center and aim her power
through that jewel which was the badge of her office. Was this
fumbling now because she must do it all without a tool, with the
skepticism of those she had long revered eating at her
confidence?</p>

<p>She had been so sure that morning when she had had that sending concerning Loyse and when she had ridden to Es with that flaming desire to be one of the Power
again&mdash;only to find doors and minds closed against all her
knocking. Then, because she had been so sure she was right, she had
gone apart, as dictated by her past training, to study this thing,
to strive to use it. And when she had had the tidings that Simon
had acted against all nature, she had guessed that the Kolder
blight had touched him, then she had used that new power, little as
she knew about it, in the fight for Simon which dropped him into
the forbidden tangle of Tormarsh. After that, she had tried again
with purpose. But were the Guardians right, was this new thing she
thought she had found merely the dying echo of the old power,
doomed to fail?</p>

<p>Simon. Jaelithe began to consider Simon apart from a goal at
which to aim thought. And from the fringe consideration of Simon
she looked inward at herself. She had surrendered her witchdom to
Simon when she wedded him, thinking this union meant more to her
than all else, accepting the penalty for that uniting. But why then
had she been so eager to seize upon this hope that her sacrifice
had been no sacrifice at all? She had left Simon to ride to Es, to
best the Guardians and prove that she was not as others, that she
was still witch as well as wife. And when they would not believe,
she had not sought out Simon, she had kept to herself, intent upon
proving them wrong. As if&mdash;as if Simon was no longer of
importance at all! Always the power&mdash;the power!</p>

<p>Was that because she had known no other force in
her life? That what Simon had awakened in her was
not lasting emotion, but merely a new thing which had
been strange and compelling enough to shake her from
the calm and ordered ways of her kind, but not deep
enough to hold her? Simon&mdash;</p>

<p>Fear&mdash;fear that such reasoning was forcing her to face
something harsh and unbearable. Jaelithe concentrated
again on Simon: standing so, with his head held high,
his grave face so seldom alight with any smile&mdash;and yet in
his eyes, always in his eyes when they met hers&mdash;</p>

<p>Jaelithe&rsquo;s head turned on the hard pillow of the bunk.</p>

<p>Simon&mdash;or the need to know that she was still a witch.
Which drove her now? As a witch she had never known this kind of
fear&mdash;not without&mdash;but within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon!&rdquo; That was not a demanding summons for
communication; it was a cry born of pain and self-doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jaelithe . . .&rdquo; Faint, far off, but yet an answer,
and in it something which steadied her, though it did not answer
her questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come.&rdquo; She added as tersely as she could what
she had done to further his plan for tracking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know where we are,&rdquo; he made answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can hardly reach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the danger: that their bond might fail. If they only
had some way of strengthening that. In shape-changing one employed
the common linkage of mutual desire to accomplish that end. Mutual
desire&mdash;but they were only two. Two&mdash;no.
Loyse&mdash;Loyse&rsquo;s desire would link with theirs in this.
But how? The girl from Verlaine had no vestige of witch power. She
had been unable to perform the simplest spells in spite of
Jaelithe&rsquo;s coaching, having the blindness in that direction
which enfeebled all but the Old Race.</p>

<p>But shape-changing worked on those who were not of the Old Race;
it had once worked on Loyse in Kars. She might not be able to pull
on the power itself, but it could react upon her. And was this
still the power?</p>

<p>Without answering Simon Jaelithe broke the faint link between
them, set in her mind instead the image of Loyse as she had last
seen the girl weeks ago in Es and using that as anchorage she
sought the spirit behind the picture.</p>

<p>Loyse!</p>

<p>Jaelithe had a blurred, momentary glimpse of a wall,
a scrap of floor, and another crouching figure that was
Simon! Loyse&mdash;for that single instant she had looked through
Loyse&rsquo;s eyes!</p>

<p>But possession was not what she wanted, contact rather. Again
she tried. This time with a message, not so deep an identification.
Foggy, as if that wisp of tie between them fluttered, anchored for
an instant, and then failed. But as Jaelithe struggled to make it
firm, it did unite and become less tenuous. Until it held Loyse.
Now for Simon&mdash;Groping, anchorage! Simon, Loyse&mdash;and it was
stronger, more consistent. Also&mdash;she gained direction from
it! What they had wanted from the first&mdash;direction!</p>

<p>Jaelithe wriggled from the confines of the bunk, kept her
footing with the aid of handgrips as she sought the deck. There was
wind billowing the sails, the narrow knife of the bow dipped into
rising waves. The sky was sullen where the sun had gone, leaving
only a few richly colored banners at the horizon.</p>

<p>That wind whipped Jaelithe&rsquo;s hair about her uncovered
head, sent spray into her face until she gasped as she reached the
post beside the rudder where two of the crew labored to hold the
ship on course, and Captain Stymir watched narrowly sky, wind and
wave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The course,&rdquo; Jaelithe caught at his shoulder to
steady herself at an unexpected incline of the decking. &ldquo;That way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so sharp set in her head that she could pivot in a half
turn and point, sure that her bearings were correct for their
purpose. He studied her for a second as if to gauge her sincerity
and then nodded, taking the helm himself.</p>

<p>The bow of the <em>Wave Cleaver</em> began to swing to
Jaelithe&rsquo;s left, coming about with due caution for
wind
and wave, away from the dark shadow of the land, out
into the sea. Somewhere under the surface of all this
turbulence was that other vessel, and Jaelithe had no
doubts at all that they were going to follow the track
of that, as long as that three-fold awareness linked Simon,
Loyse and herself.</p>

<p>She stood now wet with spray, her hair lankly plastered to her
skull, stringing on her shoulders. The last colors faded from the
sky or were blotted out by the cloud masses. Behind them even the
shadow of Estcarp&rsquo;s coast had gone. She knew so little of
the sea. This fury of wind and wave spelled storm, and could storm
so batter them from the course that they would lose the quarry?</p>

<p>Jaelithe shouted that question to the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blow&mdash;&rdquo; His words came faintly back.
&ldquo;But we have ridden out far worse and still kept on course.
What can be done, will be. For the rest, lady, it lies between the
fingers of the Old Woman!&rdquo; He spat over his shoulder in the
ritual luck-evoking gesture of his race.</p>

<p>But still she would not go below, watching in the fast gathering
darkness for something she knew she would not be able to see with
the eyes of her body, making as best she could an anchor past
breaking for the tie.</p>
