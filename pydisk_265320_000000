<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_26"></a><b>EIGHT</b></h1>
<a id="p2426" name="p2426"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2426)">At that moment I wanted no argument, for there was something about Oomark now. Though he was still a small boy, in some ways he was secretive, older. I did not like those sly glances he sent in my direction now and then&#151;gloating&#151;satisfaction at my difficulties, a searching for a change in me?</p>
<a id="p2427" name="p2427"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2427)">Once more I took out food. But he would have nothing of what I offered. I ate, a much smaller portion than I wanted. But I must ration myself. These supplies could not be renewed.</p>
<a id="p2428" name="p2428"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2428)">It began to rain, or else the mist, which had grown thicker and thicker, condensed on our bodies. I could see no farther than the outside of the ring in which we sat. Oddly enough, the heavy moisture did not make me uncomfortable.</p>
<a id="p2429" name="p2429"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2429)">There was a strange sensation in my scalp, and I raised my hands to discover my hair was not plastered to my skull by the damp but stood erect, and it could not be forced flat save by keeping a hand pressed upon it. The wet on my skin and in my hair took away my thirst.</p>
<a id="p2430" name="p2430"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2430)">When I glanced at Oomark, I saw him licking the down on the back of his hands (for it grew there now), even up his arms, just as a cat might perform its toilet fastidiously when wet, though he did not appear uncomfortable.</p>
<a id="p2431" name="p2431"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2431)">Then, with a jerk, his head snapped up, and he stared over my shoulder. I pushed around to gaze in the same direction. At first I could see only the billowing mist. Then I was aware of a darker shape that did not drift with that mist but pushed against it. Though I could not hear the slightest sound, it was padding about the circumference of the ring. Was it what had followed us?</p>
<a id="p2432" name="p2432"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2432)">I reached for the weighted bag. How I longed for a stunner, though a laser beamer would have been best. However, the thing, whatever it was, was never more than a dark shape.</p>
<a id="p2433" name="p2433"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2433)">Oomark slewed around, following it with his eyes as it moved. I wondered if he could see more of it than I did.</p>
<a id="p2434" name="p2434"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2434)">"What is it?"</p>
<a id="p2435" name="p2435"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2435)">"A Dark One."</p>
<a id="p2436" name="p2436"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2436)">His nostrils expanded as if to test the air, and then he added, "It cannot come within the ring. Also"&#151;his head lifted a little higher&#151;"there is something else out there."</p>
<a id="p2437" name="p2437"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2437)">At that moment I smelled enough to make me turn my head in disgust, a nauseating odor. Long decay and filth blew a puff of stench across our refuge. I must have uttered an exclamation, for I heard Oomark say, "That is the Dark One. Always do they smell so. But the other thing&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2438" name="p2438"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2438)">He stood up. The dark shadow passed before him on its round. But Oomark continued to look into the mist ahead of him. A moment later he shook his head.</p>
<a id="p2439" name="p2439"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2439)">"It is there. I think it watches, but I do not know what it may be, save it does not stink like a Dark One."</p>
<a id="p2440" name="p2440"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2440)">What more he might have said was drowned out in a high, carrying sound, which made me shiver. And that clarion call or trumpet summons was answered&#151;from so close by that I thought it might be that shadow beyond the ring wall. The answer came as a low, snarling growl.</p>
<a id="p2441" name="p2441"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2441)">Once more the call, surely a summons, a demand, so imperative was it. The growling followed, a protest, a sullen whine. But on the third sounding of that horn, there was no growl, rather a deep, carrying bellow, perhaps the answer demanded.</p>
<a id="p2442" name="p2442"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2442)">Oomark squatted down again, his arms about his knees, balling himself as if to make as small a target as possible to escape notice. I saw his shoulders shake in a series of shudders. His head rested now on his knees, so I could not see his face.</p>
<a id="p2443" name="p2443"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2443)">Though I searched the wall of the mist, I could no longer sight that dim shadow, nor did the stench of it linger. Off in the gray billows the horn gave another blast. Now there was no questing note in it, rather a gloating, a promise of worse to come. Before its echoes died away, there was a yapping, a noise that sent my hands in an involuntary gesture to cover my ears. I wanted to sink into the earth and pull protecting sods over me.</p>
<a id="p2444" name="p2444"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2444)">"What is it?" I asked Oomark in a half-whisper. He seemed to know so much of this place, and his fear was now so apparent that I thought he could set name to the nameless.</p>
<a id="p2445" name="p2445"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2445)">"The <i>hunt!</i> Ahhhh&#151;" His words lapsed into a moan of pure fear. "He hunts&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2446" name="p2446"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2446)">"Who?" I grasped Oomark's shoulder. He aimed a blow at me in return, as if in his present state he did not know friend from enemy. "Who? Tell me!" I shook him.</p>
<a id="p2447" name="p2447"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2447)">"The driver of Dark Ones." Those strange yellow eyes through which Oomark surveyed this alien world were fixed on the mist wall. His tongue licked his lips. "He calls his pack to a hunting&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2448" name="p2448"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2448)">There was nothing to reassure one. Still holding to Oomark, I listened, straining to pick up any sound in the dank mist. But when the horn peeled again, it was fainter, farther off, and the hideous yapping that answered it was barely audible.</p>
<a id="p2449" name="p2449"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2449)">I felt Oomark relax a little. Once more he licked his lips. He sniffed the air.</p>
<a id="p2450" name="p2450"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2450)">"The dark hound is gone," he reported.</p>
<a id="p2451" name="p2451"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2451)">I knew that I must have out of Oomark all he knew or suspected about this world. To travel on blindly, not knowing from which side and at what moment danger might leap, was too great a risk. Knowledge was my hope.</p>
<a id="p2452" name="p2452"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2452)">"Oomark, you must tell me what you know of this world&#151;of things such as the Dark Ones and the hunter&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2453" name="p2453"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2453)">Again he looked at me cornerwise, slyly.</p>
<a id="p2454" name="p2454"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2454)">"Please, Oomark. If we are to go on, I must know what dangers lurk here."</p>
<a id="p2455" name="p2455"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2455)">He shrugged. "It is of your choosing that you do not understand for yourself. You would be of that other place, not wholly of this."</p>
<a id="p2456" name="p2456"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2456)">I rebelled. "I am not in the least of this place! I would return to my <i>own</i> place."</p>
<a id="p2457" name="p2457"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2457)">"See?" He spread out his hands in a gesture of bafflement. "You choose to be one in the middle. And the hunter of Dark Ones&#151;and such as he&#151;can therefore hunt you. You ask to know&#151; The means are before you, but you will not take them."</p>
<a id="p2458" name="p2458"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2458)">"Oomark!" I drew on all my store of patience. "Tell me what you can."</p>
<a id="p2459" name="p2459"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2459)">The boy hesitated. I thought, "If he does refuse, what means have I of forcing him to it?"</p>
<a id="p2460" name="p2460"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2460)">Then he said slowly, "I do not know everything, save that when something such as the hunter's horn sounds, then here"&#151;he touched his forehead&#151;"there comes knowledge. I know what can be eaten and drunk, what we may meet on this road, and whether it be friend or foe. But before it happens, I do not know, truly. It is only what I see or hear&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2461" name="p2461"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2461)">That he spoke the truth, I did not doubt. Now before I could urge any more out of him, he raised his head a little and pointed with his chin.</p>
<a id="p2462" name="p2462"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2462)">"The One Between, who was by the rocks, he is here."</p>
<a id="p2463" name="p2463"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2463)">"What does he want?" Oomark seemed so certain, as if he could actually see the hairy creature.</p>
<a id="p2464" name="p2464"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2464)">"He hungers&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2465" name="p2465"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2465)">My mind made a horrifying guess. Were <i>we</i> the prey the thing trailed? I tightened my hold on the bag and prepared to do my best in our defense.</p>
<a id="p2466" name="p2466"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2466)">Oomark touched my arm and shook his head. "Not us. His is not the way of the hunter. No, he hungers for what you carry&#151;the food from the other place."</p>
<a id="p2467" name="p2467"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2467)">"Why?"</p>
<a id="p2468" name="p2468"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2468)">"I do not know, only that it draws him. He wants it so badly that it means the whole world to him. He can think of nothing else, only that. So I can in turn feel his great hunger in me." Oomark put his hands to his middle, rubbing himself.</p>
<a id="p2469" name="p2469"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2469)">But why? Why would a creature of this world want my few supplies? Not that he would get them, I told myself fiercely. I had that bundle safely under my hand, and the bag was also ready for any attack.</p>
<a id="p2470" name="p2470"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2470)">"Yes, that is what he wants. He will follow as long as there is strength in him. He is hurt, you know. When you struck him, he was hurt. Here." Oomark fingered his own shoulder, lightly, as if dreading to put pressure on some wound.</p>
<a id="p2471" name="p2471"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2471)">"Still he is very strong&#151;" I remembered only too well the bulk of the creature, and I had no desire to face new attack.</p>
<a id="p2472" name="p2472"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2472)">"He is tired, and he hurts. Now he has found another ring and rests in it. But when we go on, he will follow." Oomark reported confidently, and I believed him. So it would be up to us to lose or discourage that follower.</p>
<a id="p2473" name="p2473"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2473)">Oddly enough, though I had been tired when settling in this ring, I had no desire to sleep. Nor, it seemed, did Oomark. Though we talked but little thereafter, we spent the passing of time (and how much time, I could not calculate) as if we were waiting for some signal. However, it was not a waiting that made me uneasy or impatient. Rather it was a languid, quiet period between two bouts of action.</p>
<a id="p2474" name="p2474"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2474)">We heard no more sounds. Nor did any shadows move now in the mist. Finally I became aware that the curtain was lifting, that I was able to see more. Oomark got to his feet, or rather his hoofs.</p>
<a id="p2475" name="p2475"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2475)">"It is the period of outgo. Let us be on our way. I am hungry."</p>
<a id="p2476" name="p2476"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2476)">I made as if to open the supply bag. He shook his head.</p>
<a id="p2477" name="p2477"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2477)">"I want real food&#151;not that which makes one sick to smell! Come on!"</p>
<a id="p2478" name="p2478"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2478)">With that he gave a bound that cleared the darker green of the ring rim, his small hoofs clattering on a stretch of rock beyond. I looked at my boots. It was plain I could not put those on again. The bandaging must serve me for foot covering. And there was no reason to burden myself with useless things. So I left them lying as I moved after the boy.</p>
<a id="p2479" name="p2479"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2479)">The lifting of the mist came more swiftly. The ground where we had halted was level and had many rings of various sizes across it. Not too far away one of those rings was occupied. The hunched figure now getting awkwardly to its feet was that of the creature who had hunted Oomark. The tatters it wore for clothing fluttered in a breeze. It had turned its head in our direction. One arm hung by its side. But the other moved, and it extended its empty hand, palm up. I could see the mouth working as it had before when the creature tried to speak.</p>
<a id="p2480" name="p2480"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2480)">Again that effort was mighty, convulsive, until my fear was touched with a trace of sympathy. Even I could see it meant no harm, at least for now; it was pleading with us for that which I carried. Why would it so want the food Oomark disdained? The slit mouth worked, spatters of spittle showing in the corners. And the hand, trembling as if it were an effort to hold it so, stretched beseechingly to me.</p>
<a id="p2481" name="p2481"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2481)">"Come on!" Oomark had drawn ahead. He looked back impatiently. "I want food."</p>
<a id="p2482" name="p2482"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2482)">"Foooood&#151;" The word was a distorted mockery of the boy's, but the creature had uttered it.</p>
<a id="p2483" name="p2483"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2483)">I held the supplies tight to me in the crook of my arm while I swung the weighted bag with my other hand. Yet still I hesitated. And in that moment I knew that I could not do what all good sense told me was safe. I took the thong of the stone bag between my teeth, holding it ready. Then I thrust my hand in among the supplies. Without looking, I grabbed what I first touched. It was a choc piece.</p>
<a id="p2484" name="p2484"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2484)">Without watching, lest I grow more generous than I dared to be, I threw that in the general direction of the creature and ran on after Oomark.</p>
<a id="p2485" name="p2485"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2485)">But the boy had halted, and when I caught up with him, he was scowling.</p>
<a id="p2486" name="p2486"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2486)">"Why did you do that?"</p>
<a id="p2487" name="p2487"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2487)">"Because&#151;I was sorry for&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2488" name="p2488"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2488)">"For <i>that?</i>" He laughed in a way I did not like as he pointed.</p>
<a id="p2489" name="p2489"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2489)">I turned, to see the creature crouched low to the ground, pulled in upon itself as Oomark had been at the sound of that dread horn. It was making no move to follow us.</p>
<a id="p2490" name="p2490"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2490)">"What&#151;what is the matter?"</p>
<a id="p2491" name="p2491"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2491)">"You were sorry." He mocked me, his lips grinning in a smile that was not pleasant, which reminded me of&#151;Bartare! "You were sorry. But he is sorrier now!" The boy stabbed a finger at the quiet figure.</p>
<a id="p2492" name="p2492"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2492)">"Why?"</p>
<a id="p2493" name="p2493"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2493)">"You gave him food&#151;now look at him! It hurts and hurts and hurts. And he deserves that hurting! He is neither one thing nor the other. Maybe he'll be nothing at all shortly."</p>
<a id="p2494" name="p2494"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2494)">"Oomark&#151;" I tried to catch his arm, but he eluded me, laughing hatefully. "That food&#151;did it poison him?"</p>
<a id="p2495" name="p2495"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2495)">"If it did not, he'll wish that it had. You will, too, Kilda, you will, too. Look at yourself&#151;just look!"</p>
<a id="p2496" name="p2496"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2496)">It was his turn to grab my arm and swing it up before my eyes in a hold tight enough to bruise.</p>
<a id="p2497" name="p2497"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2497)">That brown shine on my skin had increased. There was a kind of hard shell developing from my flesh. I jerked away, refusing to look.</p>
<a id="p2498" name="p2498"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2498)">"You cannot stop it, you know." Oomark lost some of his mockery. "Look at me!" He danced from one small hoof to the other, turning so that I could see him from every angle. His hands pulled at his tunic, loosening it. Now he threw that and his under tunic from him so he was bare to the waist. Bare&#151;no! His small body was completely covered with a soft gray down. It was thinner on his arms and shoulders&#151;I could see through it to his skin&#151;but at his waist it grew longer and thicker.</p>
<a id="p2499" name="p2499"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2499)">"Put on your clothes!" I tried to give that order my old authority.</p>
<a id="p2500" name="p2500"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2500)">"No!" He kicked at one of the tunics. "No!" He stretched wide his arms and capered in a grotesque dance. "Those are hot. They scratch. I do not need them any more&#151;ever!" He went skittering away, as if he feared I would catch and try to clothe him by force. Unlike the discarded boots, I did not leave them lying. Rather I rolled them tightly and stuffed them into the top of the stone bag.</p>
<a id="p2501" name="p2501"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2501)">"Come on!" He beckoned to me. But I glanced back once more at the hairy thing.</p>
<a id="p2502" name="p2502"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2502)">Was Oomark right? Had the food the alien begged for so piteously indeed proven poison? But if our natural food had been fatal to it, why had it&#151;or he&#151;wanted it so badly&#151;dogged us, begged? And if our food was poison to a creature of this world, would it not follow that native food would be so to us? I had eaten nothing save from what I carried. But Oomark&#151;</p>
<a id="p2503" name="p2503"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2503)">I put all thoughts of the stricken creature out of my mind to run after the boy, determined that this time I would not allow him to take such a risk.</p>
<a id="p2504" name="p2504"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2504)">But it was too late, for he stood beside a large bush or small tree planted at one end of a mound. It was heavy with golden berries, and Oomark was not the only feaster. From some of the branches hung those gauzy-winged things I had seen in the woods. And in the grass were small animals.</p>
<a id="p2505" name="p2505"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2505)">Neither winged things nor animals took any notice of Oomark, nor did they when I approached. They were too intent upon feeding. The berries were large, perhaps the size of my thumb, and so full of juice that they spattered widely when their skin broke. Oomark pushed them into his mouth three and four together, so the juice trickled down his chin, dripping into the hair on his chest.</p>
<a id="p2506" name="p2506"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2506)">"Here." He held out a sticky hand, three of the globes on it. When I shook my head (and it took determination to do that, for they made me long to taste), he grinned. Then he shrugged and popped the refused berries into his own mouth.</p>
<a id="p2507" name="p2507"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2507)">I drew away, realizing I had no chance to stop him, afraid I might yield to temptation. I made special note of the mound by which that bush grew. It was odd to find it in that level land, and it gave the impression of being purposefully humped there for some forgotten reason. Also, it was only the first of a series of such that were erected in a straight line. I counted nine within the visibility limits of the mist.</p>
<a id="p2508" name="p2508"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2508)">Each of these had a bush or tree planted at one end. But not all of those were alike. Three were of the yellow fruit. Three bore larger spheres, which would fit into the palm of my hand, and these were a dark purple-red. At them no feasters crowded. In fact, there was something repellent about them. The leaves of the trees there were also not uniformly shaped, but irregular and of a green so dark as to be near black.</p>
<a id="p2509" name="p2509"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2509)">The other three trees had a much lighter foliage&#151;a silver edge to long ribbony leaves of a very pale green. Their slender trunks and branches were not covered with rough bark, but smooth and of a silver shade also. They had no fruit, only clusters of white flowers, which swayed gently, even though there seemed to be no wind. Now and then I caught a whiff of a fragrance so sweet that I longed to run and bury my face in one of those clusters. But, like the purple fruit, they seemed to ward off touch, though I did not have the same distaste for them as I did for the dark fruit.</p>
<a id="p2510" name="p2510"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2510)">These trees were all planted in a pattern: first the golden berries, then the purple spheres, last the silver flowers. Then they began all over again, through the same series twice more. So I was very sure this was of a purpose. What were these mounds? Graves of rulers or priests now long forgotten? There hung about them an aura of age, of settling into the earth, which did not come only from passing years, but also from the weight of centuries. Or were these the remains of buildings, soil-encased, perhaps the last of some ancient fortress?</p>
<a id="p2511" name="p2511"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2511)">It would seem Oomark had had his fill, for he came away from the bush to kneel and rub his hands in the grass, pulling up a tuft to smear the juice from his face, though his efforts at cleanliness were not too successful.</p>
<a id="p2512" name="p2512"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2512)">Then he turned about to face the mound and lifted both hands. Holding them palm out, he spoke, certainly not to me, nor to the hopping and flying things still feeding.</p>
<a id="p2513" name="p2513"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2513)">"My thanks, Sleeper, for the bounty of the table, the richness of the feast."</p>
<a id="p2514" name="p2514"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2514)">The words had the ring of ritual, a form of invoking the invisible. Once said, he did not linger, but came to me as one prepared for brisk action.</p>
<a id="p2515" name="p2515"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2515)">"Who is the Sleeper?"</p>
<a id="p2516" name="p2516"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2516)">Oomark looked puzzled and glanced back to the mound. "I don't know."</p>
<a id="p2517" name="p2517"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2517)">"But you said&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2518" name="p2518"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2518)">"I said that because it is right and fitting. Don't be asking, asking, asking all the time, Kilda! If you would eat, you would know&#151;you wouldn't have to ask!"</p>
<a id="p2519" name="p2519"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2519)">"I would know if I ate. Is that how you know, Oomark?"</p>
<a id="p2520" name="p2520"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2520)">"I guess so. Anyway, I know you thank the Sleeper after you eat here. The Folk always have."</p>
<a id="p2521" name="p2521"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2521)">He started away on a course that paralleled the first of the mounds, passing the purple fruit, coming to the silver flowers.</p>
<a id="p2522" name="p2522"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2522)">"What about these?" I still tried to add to my store of knowledge. "There are more fruit&#151;"</p>
<a id="p2523" name="p2523"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2523)">"No!" He averted his gaze from the purple spheres. "You eat those&#151;you die. Not all the Sleepers have kind thoughts for the Folk. You don't eat these, and you don't <i>touch</i> those!" He pointed to the flowers.</p>
<a id="p2524" name="p2524"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2524)">"Are they so deadly then?"</p>
<a id="p2525" name="p2525"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2525)">Again he seemed puzzled. "No&#151;not in the same way. It is&#151;they might serve the Folk if they could, but it is not in them to do so." His frown of puzzlement grew deeper. "I really don't know, Kilda. The fruit is bad because the Sleeper there hates us. But the flowers&#151;they are not enough like the Folk to be touched."</p>
<a id="p2526" name="p2526"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2526)">Three grades of Sleepers, I deduced&#151;those offering the berries for refreshment, those dangerous and evil, and those too unlike the inhabitants to make contact. Or was I being fanciful now and reading too much into what I had seen and Oomark's words?</p>
<a id="p2527" name="p2527"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2527)">As we passed the mound with the silver tree, its clusters of flowers and the long banner-like leaves began to ripple. A wind of high force might have been tearing at them. Yet the trees at the flanking mounds showed no such troubling. Finally that tearing snapped a small branch heavily weighted with a ball of flowers. It did not fall to the ground, but rather whirled over and over through the air until it was thrust as one might thrust the pointed head of a spear, the splintered end down, into the ground at my feet.</p>
<a id="p2528" name="p2528"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2528)">Oomark cried out and backed away. On impulse I stooped and caught at the branch under the nodding flower cluster. It was like grasping a rod of ice, so cold was the sting from it that ran up my arm. Yet I could not let it go. Instead I pulled it from the grip of the soil.</p>
<a id="p2529" name="p2529"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2529)">The gale that had broken it free from its parent tree and brought it to me had ceased as if it had never blown. And&#151;my fingers&#151;!</p>
<a id="p2530" name="p2530"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2530)">The brown, hard crust over them was cracking, flaking away like a dusty powder. The flesh so uncovered was still brown, but it was the skin I had always known. Though my hand was still cold, I had no desire to throw the branch from me. Instead, I made it fast to my belt.</p>
<a id="p2531" name="p2531"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2531)">Oomark retreated again. "Throw it away&#151;back to where it came from!" He gestured to the now quiet tree. "It will hurt you!"</p>
<a id="p2532" name="p2532"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2532)">I flexed my fingers and saw with awe and gratitude the normal flesh. "Such hurt I will take gladly. See, Oomark, my hand is now as it always was!"</p>
<a id="p2533" name="p2533"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2533)">He cried out and ran from me as he had fled from the hairy creature. I might now have been a horror, hunting him.</p>
<a id="p2534" name="p2534"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(2534)">&#160;</p>
