<h2 class="chapter">23</h2>

<p>I felt it begin before any growl of drum or snarl of trumpet. I
ran for the wagon, leaping rocks and fires in the mist.</p>

<p>I had Smoke take me up where Mogaba watched from his high tower,
sensed uncertainty immediately. He knew Croaker. He knew that half
what the Old Man did would be done to mess with his mind. But which
half?</p>

<p>The knowing itself would cause a hesitation at every point of
decision.</p>

<p>I loathed Mogaba the traitor but admired Mogaba the man. He was
tall, handsome, intelligent. Just like me. But he was the perfect
warrior, too.</p>

<p>He had no company but couriers and the two big wazoos. And they
were doing a great imitation of two guys sleeping. Their strategy
was to wait for Lady to make a move so one could grab her while the
other one blindsided her.</p>

<p>Mogaba&rsquo;s platform provided a less than perfect view though
probably the best attainable. A portion of his left flank was
masked by a jumble of boulders while to his right a steep knee of
stone concealed his flank there along with a portion of the Taglian
left wing.</p>

<p>I took Smoke up amongst the crows for a vulture&rsquo;s
eye view. The smoke was thinning out. People were stumbling uphill,
unable to make an orderly advance over the rocky ground.</p>

<p>Now I understood why the troops had been issued calthrops.</p>

<p>Calthrops are like large kids&rsquo; jacks, only the tips are
sharp and sometimes poisoned. The calthrop is a handy tool if you
have to run for it, particularly if the guys after you are going to
be on horseback. You scatter calthrops where horses have to follow
narrow paths and you have yourself a guaranteed head start or even
grounds for a nasty ambush.</p>

<p>Aha! I spied the missing complimentary in-law.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj was dressed up in his best outfit, his holy fencing
duds, like he maybe did not want us going to a whole lot of trouble
when we laid him out. Hell. I would have to check with Thai Dei on
Nyueng Bao funeral customs. A lot of Nyueng Bao had died around me
but I never took part in what went on later.</p>

<p>I still resented being left out when they took care of To Tan
and Sahra without me.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj strutted uphill till he was just fifty feet from the
first line of Shadowlanders. He stopped and bellowed a challenge to
Narayan Singh.</p>

<p>Guess who did not come out to fight? Nobody even answered.
Nobody even bothered to relay the message to the Deceiver camp.</p>

<p>Uncle Doj began issuing a series of formal insults, belittling
the Deceivers and all their allies. Trouble was, they were formal
insults from a stylized school of challenge and response. He did
not know how to make his presentation in a manner accessible to
people who did not speak Nyueng Bao.</p>

<p>Poor Uncle. Forty years of intense preparation brought him to
the ultimate moment and all those guys over there saw was a crazy
old man.</p>

<p>Doj began to get it.</p>

<p>He began to get angry for real. He started yelling his
challenges in Taglian. A few Shadowlanders understood him. His
message soon reached the Deceivers. It was not well received.</p>

<p>I found the show as amusing as anything could be out there.</p>

<p>None of this was part of the Captain&rsquo;s plan.</p>

<p>Uncle kept hollering.</p>

<p>Over in the Deceiver camp the miniature messiah of the
Stranglers told his cronies, &ldquo;We will not respond. We will
wait. Darkness is our time. And darkness always comes.&rdquo; After
a pause he asked, &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wide, creepy looking guy told him, &ldquo;He was in Dejagore.
One of the Nyueng Bao pilgrims.&rdquo; The man speaking was named
Sindhu. He had come into Dejagore during the siege to spy for Lady
and for the Deceivers. He was a real villain. I had been sure he
was dead.</p>

<p>The Sahras die but the Sindhus and Narayan Singhs go on. Which
is why I cannot be a religious man. Unless the Gunni are right and
there is a wheel of life and eventually everybody gets what they
deserve.</p>

<p>Sindhu continued, &ldquo;He was a priest of some kind and their
Speaker. A member of his family eventually wed the standardbearer
of the Black Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It becomes clear. The Goddess is scribbling one of her
subtle death plays.&rdquo; He glanced at the Daughter of Night. The
kid sat so still it was spooky. Spookier than usual. No
four-year-old could do that.</p>

<p>Narayan Singh seemed vaguely troubled. His goddess enjoyed the
occasional death joke at the expense of her most devout followers.
He did not want to become one of her pranks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkness is our time,&rdquo; he said again.
&ldquo;Darkness always comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darkness always comes. Sounded like Kina&rsquo;s motto. I took
another look at Lady and Croaker&rsquo;s brat. She bothered me bad.
She was spookier every time I looked. If it had not been so hard to
care out there I could have cried for Lady and the Old Man.</p>

<p>Actually, I almost could. Maybe I was becoming capable of
feeling while I worked.</p>

<p>I drifted away, found that Mogaba was taking stronger exception
to Uncle&rsquo;s antics than was Singh. But he remembered Uncle Doj
from the bad old days. &ldquo;I want that man silenced,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The soldiers are watching him instead of their
enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he drew no response from the Deceivers, Uncle Doj began
insulting the Shadowlanders and their masters. A javelin streaked
his way. In a motion too swift to follow he drew Ash Wand and
brushed the missile aside. &ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;Renegades! Are any of you Nar men enough to come out?&rdquo;
He exposed his back contemptuously, headed for friendly lines
before a missile storm could devour him. A masterful move, it did
not look like a withdrawal at all.</p>
