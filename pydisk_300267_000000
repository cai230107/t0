<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_32"></a><b>Chapter 21</b></h1>
<a id="p4169" name="p4169"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4169)">It was so unexpected&#151;so totally unexpected&#151;that Winward never even had a chance to react. One minute he was walking around the tower with his Qasaman escort, surreptitiously searching the building and immediate area for weapons and additional guards and trying to work out exactly what he would say when they reached whoever he was being taken to. Just walking peacefully&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. and then the leader muttered something and turned around&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and before Winward could do more than focus on the other the night lit up with a thunderous flash and a sledgehammer slammed into the center of his chest, blowing him backwards into nothingness as the crack of the lethal shot echoed in his ears.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p4170" name="p4170"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4170)">The blackness in his brain faded slowly, and for what seemed like hours he drifted slowly toward the reality he could faintly sense above him. The pain came first&#151;dull, throbbing pain in his chest; sharp, stinging pain in his eyes and face&#151;and with that breakthrough the rest of his senses began to function again. Sounds filtered in: footsteps, doors opening and closing, occasional incomprehensible voices. He discovered he was on his back, bouncing rhythmically as if being carried, and every so often he felt a trickle of something run down his ribs under his tunic.</p>
<a id="p4171" name="p4171"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4171)">And slowly, he realized what had happened.</p>
<a id="p4172" name="p4172"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4172)">He'd been shot. Deliberately and maliciously shot. And was probably dying.</p>
<a id="p4173" name="p4173"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4173)">The only general rule he could recall from his first-aid training was that injury victims should not be unnecessarily moved. And so he remained still, eyes closed against the pain there, as he waited for loss of blood to dim his consciousness back into darkness.</p>
<a id="p4174" name="p4174"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4174)">But it wasn't happening. On the contrary, with each passing heartbeat he felt his mind sharpening, with strength and sensation rapidly returning to his limbs. Far from dying, he was actually coming back to life.</p>
<a id="p4175" name="p4175"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4175)">What the hell?</p>
<a id="p4176" name="p4176"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4176)">And it was only then, as his body and brain finally meshed enough to localize his wound, that he realized what had happened.</p>
<a id="p4177" name="p4177"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4177)">The Qasaman had shot him in the center of his chest. Directly over the breastbone. The breastbone which, coated with ceramic laminae, was functionally unbreakable.</p>
<a id="p4178" name="p4178"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4178)">The aftermath was less clear, but its main points weren't hard to figure out. The bullet's impact had knocked the air out of him, possibly even temporarily stopped his heart, and for the past few seconds or minutes he'd been fighting to get oxygen back into his system. His face and eyes must have taken the impact of burning propellant to sting as they did, and for a painful heartbeat he recognized that he might have been permanently blinded.</p>
<a id="p4179" name="p4179"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4179)">But somehow even that didn't seem important at the moment. He was alive, he was reasonably functional&#151;</p>
<a id="p4180" name="p4180"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4180)">And the Qasamans thought he was dead.</p>
<a id="p4181" name="p4181"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4181)">They would pay for that mistake. Pay in blood.</p>
<a id="p4182" name="p4182"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4182)">Starting right now. Winward's eyes might be unusable, but the optical enhancers set into the skin around them were harder to damage and fed into the optic nerves further back inside the skull's protection. They weren't really designed to replace normal vision, but a minute's experimentation showed that a zero-magnification setting combined with the lowest light-amp level provided an adequate picture.</p>
<a id="p4183" name="p4183"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4183)">Between the four head-and-upper-torsos bobbing at the edges of the view, he could see a ceiling passing overhead. Carefully, keeping the motion slow, he eased his head a few degrees to the side. A couple of doors went by, the party turned a corner, and abruptly they were through open double doors and into a white-walled room with bright steel fixtures extending to the ceiling in various places. The four stretcher-bearers set him down on a hard table, and he let his head loll so to leave it turned to his right, toward the exit. The men left, closing the doors behind them, and he was alone.</p>
<a id="p4184" name="p4184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4184)">Though probably not for long. The room he was in was very obviously a sick bay or surgery, and in the Qasamans' place Winward would want a preliminary dissection started on a dead Cobra as quickly as possible. The doctors were probably prepping in another room, and could arrive at any time.</p>
<a id="p4185" name="p4185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4185)">Forcing himself to again move slowly, Winward eased his head up and down until he located the glassy eye of a fisheye monitor camera. It was in a back upper corner, out of direct line of any of his lasers or his sonic disrupter. He could lift his hands and fire, of course, but if someone was watching the monitor closely the alarm would be raised before he even got through the double doors into the hall. Using his omnidirectional sonic to shake up the picture before shooting wouldn't help appreciably, either. What he really needed was a diversion.</p>
<a id="p4186" name="p4186"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4186)">Behind him there was the sound of a door opening, and a second later four white-gowned people came around the maze of support equipment and into view.</p>
<a id="p4187" name="p4187"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4187)">And a diversion abruptly became vital. The soldiers and stretcher-carriers outside might miss his slow breathing or the fact that the skin of his chest was still bleeding, but the approaching doctors hadn't a chance in hell of doing so. He had to keep them away before they found out he was still alive.</p>
<a id="p4188" name="p4188"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4188)">The leader was within a meter of him now. Activating his omnidirectional, Winward ran it to its lowest frequency setting and held his breath.</p>
<a id="p4189" name="p4189"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4189)">Their reaction was all he could have hoped for. The leader jerked to a stop as the inaudible waves hit him, the second in line stumbling into him as she staggered slightly. For a minute they all stood together in a little knot just beyond the most uncomfortable zone, conversing in voices that sounded both concerned and irritated. Winward waited, gritting his teeth himself against the gut-rattling sound as he waited for their next move.</p>
<a id="p4190" name="p4190"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4190)">It came quickly, and was one more indication of how much the high command wanted the Cobra dissected <i>immediately. </i>Waving the others back, the leader picked up a sharp-looking instrument from a nearby tray and stepped to the table. He reached down to pull back Winward's tunic&#151;</p>
<a id="p4191" name="p4191"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4191)">And jumped back with a strangled gasp as the Cobra's sonic disrupter flash-heated the skin of his hand. Followed by one of the others, he dashed around the table to the back door, shouting as he ran.</p>
<a id="p4192" name="p4192"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4192)">The door opened and closed, and for a moment the last two Qasamans huddled together, whispering in fear or awe or both to each other. Winward tried to guess what they'd try next, but the grinding of his sonic combined with the throbbing pain in his chest and face was fogging his mind too much for him to hold a coherent train of thought.</p>
<a id="p4193" name="p4193"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4193)">Again, he didn't have long to wait. One of the two disappeared toward the back of the room, returning a minute later with a coil of insulated electrical cable. Snaring a knife from the instrument tray, he began stripping the insulation from one end&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and as the other Qasaman plugged the wire's other end into what appeared to be a ground socket beneath a wall outlet, Winward realized with growing excitement that the break he'd hoped for was here.</p>
<a id="p4194" name="p4194"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4194)">Clearly, the Qasamans had jumped to the conclusion that their colleague had suffered an electrical burn from Winward's body and were preparing to try and drain the excess charge away.</p>
<a id="p4195" name="p4195"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4195)">Another minute and they were ready. The first Qasaman replaced the knife in the tray and swung the bare copper wire gently as he prepared to loft it over the Cobra's chest. Moving his right hand fractionally, Winward lined up his fingertip laser on the socket where the cable had been grounded. It was going to be a bit of a stretch, but he had no choice but to try it. The copper snake flew through the air, draped itself across his chest&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and Winward fired his arcthrower.</p>
<a id="p4196" name="p4196"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4196)">A bit of a stretch indeed, and for a heart-stopping fraction of a second he watched the clean light of the laser burning its solitary way through the air without any response from the capacitors deep within his body cavity. Then the split second was past, and the ionized path reached the required conductance and a lightning bolt shattered the air. And even as the thunderclap seemed to split open Winward's head, the sudden current flow overloaded the circuit breakers&#151;</p>
<a id="p4197" name="p4197"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4197)">And the room was plunged into darkness.</p>
<a id="p4198" name="p4198"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4198)">Winward was off the table before the echoes had faded away; was out through the double doors a second later. If the monitor camera hadn't been taken out with the room's lights, it was almost guaranteed that the afterimage of that flash would mask the brief flicker of hall light as the Cobra escaped.</p>
<a id="p4199" name="p4199"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4199)">For a wonder, the hall was deserted. Presumably the medical area had no command stations within it and, hence, little traffic under normal conditions. He headed down the hall to look for a stairway; and as he did so, he carefully pried open his eyelids.</p>
<a id="p4200" name="p4200"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4200)">Nothing. The Qasaman's gunshot had blinded him. Perhaps beyond even Aventine's surgical abilities.</p>
<a id="p4201" name="p4201"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4201)">The cold fury simmering within him began to heat up again. Along with York's arm, it was one more score to be settled with this world.</p>
<a id="p4202" name="p4202"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4202)">He changed hallways twice before spotting anyone; and when he finally did, he hit the entire jackpot at once. Rounding a corner, he was just in time to see the elevator he'd been seeking disgorge a half dozen Qasamans barely ten meters away from him. One of them was the man who'd shot him.</p>
<a id="p4203" name="p4203"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4203)">The whole group froze in shock, and even the limited quality of his enhancer image gave Winward the grim satisfaction of watching sheer unbelieving terror flood into his former assailant's face. Three seconds they all stood there; four seconds, five&#151;and, abruptly, they all went madly for their weapons.</p>
<a id="p4204" name="p4204"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4204)">Winward pirouetted on his right foot and cut a blaze of death across them with his antiarmor laser.</p>
<a id="p4205" name="p4205"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4205)">The mojos escaped that first shot, but even as they swept toward him in impotent rage his fingertip lasers shot them to the floor. Winward didn't waste a backward glance as he jumped over the charred bodies and between the closing elevator doors. The selector panel gave him momentary pause&#151;there were at least three times as many buttons as the tower ought to need. But he knew where he needed to go. Pushing the top button, he listened to the faint hum of the elevator's motor and prepared himself for combat.</p>
<a id="p4206" name="p4206"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4206)">The door opened, and he stepped out into a dimly-lit room to face a dozen drawn pistols.</p>
<a id="p4207" name="p4207"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4207)">They barked as one&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but Winward was no longer in the line of fire. Leg servos snapped him upwards, flipped him over in time to hit the ceiling feet first, crashing shin-deep through the tiles there to bounce off the stronger ceiling above; pushed him back toward the floor behind the line of gunmen, again flipping him over in midflight. He hit the floor with fingertip lasers blazing&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. and it was doubtful that any of the Qasamans realized what had happened before they died.</p>
<a id="p4208" name="p4208"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4208)">Again the mojos outlived their masters, and again Winward made that escape momentary. But this time one of them got through before dying, its talons opening up a ten-centimeter gash in his left arm.</p>
<a id="p4209" name="p4209"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4209)">"Damn it all," Winward snarled aloud, tearing off the bloody tunic sleeve and wrapping it awkwardly around the wound. The ambush meant the alarm had gone out, though he hadn't heard any sirens&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and as he focused for the first time on the room around him, he realized why they hadn't needed any such warning.</p>
<a id="p4210" name="p4210"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4210)">Ringing the room at eye level were large windows&#151;presumably one-way since he hadn't noticed any windows this high from the outside&#151;through which he could see the <i>Dewdrop </i>lying so painfully vulnerable out on the darkened landing field. Below the windows was a ring of monitor displays.</p>
<a id="p4211" name="p4211"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4211)">So he'd found the situation room, or at least an auxiliary one. On some of the displays armed men were rushing about madly, and Winward stepped back to the elevator doors to listen. The car was on its way up&#151;filled, no doubt, with suicidal soldiers. Looking around the room, he found the three monitor cameras and put laser bolts into each. Blinder now than he was, they'd just have to guess what he was up to&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and while they sweated that one, he had a couple more surprises in store for them.</p>
<a id="p4212" name="p4212"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4212)">Moving to the side away from the <i>Dewdrop, </i>he put his face to the windows there and looked down. He hadn't had much of a look out back before he was shot, but he'd seen <i>something&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;</i>and, sure enough, from above he could pick out the heavy guns waiting in the tower's shadow. Ready to be pushed from cover and throw explosives at the ship&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but only if there was someone there to do the pushing.</p>
<a id="p4213" name="p4213"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4213)">The nearest monitor cabinet displayed duplicates of a dozen other screens around the room, as if it was the feeder nexus for another monitor station elsewhere in the building. Winward sent an arcthrower charge into the mechanism to trip out any power lines; then, gripping it firmly, he pulled it out of its wall fastenings and raised it to a precarious balance over his head. The glass&#151;or whatever&#151;of the window was tough: it took nearly fifteen seconds of the Cobra's sonic disruptor. Winward wondered what those below would make of the sudden rain of glass as he stepped to the opening and hurled the cabinet at one of the guns with all the accuracy and strength his Cobra gear could give him.</p>
<a id="p4214" name="p4214"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4214)">The startled yelps began the instant before the cabinet smashed into the gun crew; and, simultaneously, the elevator doors across the room slid open. But Winward didn't stay to count the reinforcements. Stepping into the shattered window frame, he turned and jumped in a single motion. His hands grabbed the window's upper edge as he flew past it, changing his direction and angular velocity just enough to pinwheel him neatly onto the tower roof.</p>
<a id="p4215" name="p4215"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4215)">And right into the middle of a small crowd who'd apparently rushed over to investigate the commotion below.</p>
<a id="p4216" name="p4216"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4216)">Winward didn't bother with lasers or sonics for this group, and they <i>still </i>didn't have a chance. Swinging his arms like a servo-powered threshing machine, he hurled them in all directions, bleeding or stunned. The mojos were a different story; but he was getting used to their arch-winged attack, and took a perverse pleasure in burning them out of the air.</p>
<a id="p4217" name="p4217"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4217)">And that flicker of overconfidence nearly killed him&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;because four of the Qasaman contingent had stayed by their weapons across the roof, and as Winward looked up from his latest carnage, he found their four mojos arrowing in bare meters away.</p>
<a id="p4218" name="p4218"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4218)">His computerized reflexes saved him in that first instant, recognizing the projectile threat and hurling him down and to the side in a flat dive and roll. It was a maneuver he'd experienced innumerable times while fighting spine leopards&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but neither spine leopards nor the antipersonnel missiles the system had been designed for had the mojos' hairpin maneuverability. Winward had barely rolled back to his feet when the first two birds reached him&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and this time they got through his defenses.</p>
<a id="p4219" name="p4219"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4219)">He gasped with shock and pain as talons dug deep into his left forearm, a beak shredding at the makeshift bandage he'd wrapped around the gash there. He twisted his head aside barely in time to avoid the second mojo's slashing attack at his face, but even so its wing caught him full across the eyes, smashing the tip of his nose with stunning force. The last two mojos reached him then, one swooping down to a grip on his right forearm, the other landing on his right shoulder and digging its beak into his cheek.</p>
<a id="p4220" name="p4220"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4220)">And Winward went berserk.</p>
<a id="p4221" name="p4221"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4221)">He dropped onto his back and slammed both forearms hard onto the rooftop, feeling mojo bones crack under the crushing impact. He smashed them down again and again until the bloodied pulps loosened their grips and fell off. Reaching up with his right hand, he grabbed another mojo by the neck and twisted hard. He heard it snap; and then the last bird was back, diving toward his face. He grabbed for its feet, missed, caught the wings instead, and pulled sideways. One wing tore off, and Winward hurled both pieces from him. Across the roof there was the flash-boom of a gunshot and a bullet whistled past him. Winward swept his antiarmor laser across the crouching gunmen, then leaped to his feet and ran to them.</p>
<a id="p4222" name="p4222"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4222)">All four were dead. Winward glared down at them, gasping for air&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and as his rage subsided into the rivers of new pain coming from arms, cheek, and shoulder, his brain began to function again and his eyes searched out the weapons his enemies had been manning.</p>
<a id="p4223" name="p4223"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4223)">Mortars, or something very much like them. Simple tubes with a firing mechanism at the bottom, the shells stacked nearby. By inference, they were designed with an equally simple impact detonator. Scooping up an armful, he trotted back to the rear of the roof.</p>
<a id="p4224" name="p4224"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4224)">A couple of faces were peering upwards from the window he'd smashed, and his first shell therefore went in there. The explosion blew out a couple more windows, and Winward followed it with one aimed more toward the monitor room's center. Then he turned his attention to the guns and ground crews shooting uselessly at him from below. By the time his arms were empty it was abundantly clear that those cannons wouldn't be firing again for a long time.</p>
<a id="p4225" name="p4225"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4225)">Behind him, the roof stairway door slammed open. Winward didn't even bother to look, but grabbed the parapet edge and swung down into the room below. His nanocomputer compensated for a slight overbalance, and he landed among the glass shards on his feet.</p>
<a id="p4226" name="p4226"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4226)">The place was a mess. Where the two mortar shells had hit, floor and ceiling were torn and blackened. Dozens of the monitor screens had been smashed by flying debris; the rest were blank. At least six bodies were visible.</p>
<a id="p4227" name="p4227"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4227)"><i>I did all this. </i>The thought hit him with unexpected force, sending a queasy shiver through his body. For the first time in his life, he truly understood why the Dominion of Man had won its war against the Trofts&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and why its citizens had rejected their returning protectors.</p>
<a id="p4228" name="p4228"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4228)">Gingerly, he picked his way through the rubble to the elevator and pushed the call button. Risky, perhaps, if the Qasamans hadn't learned yet not to send piles of people against him. But the emotional reaction combined with loss of blood was making him feel light-headed, and for the moment the elevator seemed safer than trying to handle stairs.</p>
<a id="p4229" name="p4229"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4229)">An instant later a flash of light from the side caught his eye, and he turned to find the woods beyond the <i>Dewdrop </i>on fire.</p>
<a id="p4230" name="p4230"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4230)">Involuntarily, he hissed with the fear that he'd been too late, that the ship was being attacked. But on the heels of that came the memory of his instructions to Telek before he left. F'ahl had heard the explosions and obediently swept the forest with laser fire. What it had done to the soldiers waiting there was uncertain; but it had sure as hell not done much for the foliage, and if any surviving Qasamans were still at their posts they were probably thinking more of escape than attack.</p>
<a id="p4231" name="p4231"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4231)">Speaking of which.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p4232" name="p4232"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4232)">The elevator car arrived&#151;empty&#151;and he punched the second button from the top. For a wonder, the elevator performed as directed&#151;perhaps the override controls had been on the top floor?&#151;and he bounded out into a small, deserted room.</p>
<a id="p4233" name="p4233"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4233)">Deserted, but not quiet. Like the floor above, this one was filled with electronic gear, and from a panel near the middle two voices were speaking.</p>
<a id="p4234" name="p4234"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4234)">Propping open the elevator doors, Winward stepped over to the talkative board. Communications, probably, left running when the people on duty heard the ruckus overhead and wisely cut out. He wondered whether the mike at this end was still open, decided there was a simple way to find out. "Can you hear me?" he called.</p>
<a id="p4235" name="p4235"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4235)">The voices stopped abruptly. "Who are you?" one of them asked a moment later in passable Anglic.</p>
<a id="p4236" name="p4236"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4236)">"Michael Winward, currently in charge of this tower," he said. If he was lucky, they'd tell him why he wasn't really in control yet, and he'd know where he needed to attack next. Link should already be on his way over from the <i>Dewdrop; </i>together the two of them should be able to make a respectable showing&#151;</p>
<a id="p4237" name="p4237"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4237)">"Michael, this is Almo," Pyre's voice cut unexpectedly into the line. "What's your situation?"</p>
<a id="p4238" name="p4238"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4238)">Winward had to try twice to get any words out. "Almo! Where <i>are </i>you?"</p>
<a id="p4239" name="p4239"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4239)">"In the mayor's underground command center," Pyre replied. "Your return from the dead seems to have rattled him somewhat."</p>
<a id="p4240" name="p4240"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4240)">Despite his pain and weakness, Winward felt a grim smile spread across his face. Rattled, indeed. Out-and-out terrified, if the man had any sense at all.</p>
<a id="p4241" name="p4241"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4241)">Pyre was speaking again. "Now, Mr. Mayor, the situation seems to have changed. I have you, Winward has the tower&#151;"</p>
<a id="p4242" name="p4242"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4242)">"He does not control the tower," Kimmeron put in. "I have been speaking to the tower commander&#151;"</p>
<a id="p4243" name="p4243"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4243)">"I can take control whenever I wish," Winward interrupted harshly. Pyre was clearly attempting to negotiate with the Qasamans; the stronger the hand Winward could give him, the better the chances he could get back to the ship before he passed out from loss of blood. "And the weapons trained on the <i>Dewdrop </i>have been neutralized. F'ahl can lift any time he wants to."</p>
<a id="p4244" name="p4244"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4244)">Kimmeron's voice was low, but his words were precise. "You seek to trade your lives for more of ours. I have said that that is an unacceptable bargain. You know too much about us; at whatever additional cost, you must not be allowed to leave."</p>
<a id="p4245" name="p4245"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4245)">Winward didn't wait for Pyre's reply, but stepped quickly back into the elevator. In Kimmeron's place he would probably have made the same decision, and before Pyre's negotiations officially broke down he wanted to be on his way back to the <i>Dewdrop. </i>The long floor-selection panel gleamed at him as he reached toward it&#151;</p>
<a id="p4246" name="p4246"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4246)">And paused.</p>
<a id="p4247" name="p4247"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4247)">All those those buttons&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;<i>far </i>more than a building this size needed.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<a id="p4248" name="p4248"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4248)">Blocking the doors open again, he stepped back into the communications room. Pyre was saying something about mass destruction; Winward didn't bother to let him finish. "Almo?" he called. "Listen&#151;remember the idea someone had that a lot of the Qasaman industry was underground? I think this tower is an entrance to the place. Shall I go out and get Dorjay and head down to take a look?"</p>
<a id="p4249" name="p4249"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4249)">He waited, heart pounding, hoping Pyre would know how to use the opening he'd just given him. Winward had a dim idea, but his mind was beginning to fog over, and he knew instinctively he couldn't trust it to follow any straight logical lines. He hoped Pyre was in better shape.</p>
<a id="p4250" name="p4250"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4250)">"You seem upset, Mr. Mayor," Pyre's voice came through the fog. "May I assume your underground facilities are something you'd rather we not see?" There was no response, and after a moment Pyre went on, "We <i>can </i>get down there, you know. You've seen what we can do, and how little effect your guns have on us. With our ship free and clear, we can go down the tower, take a good look, and still get off Qasama alive."</p>
<a id="p4251" name="p4251"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4251)">"We will kill you all," Kimmeron said.</p>
<a id="p4252" name="p4252"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4252)">"You know better than that. So I'll offer you a deal: release all our people unharmed and we'll leave without seeing what you've got down there."</p>
<a id="p4253" name="p4253"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4253)">Kimmeron's laugh was a harsh bark. "You seek to trade something for a lack of something. Even if I wanted to agree, how could I persuade others to do so?"</p>
<a id="p4254" name="p4254"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4254)">"You explain that we take home details of city and village life, or we take home every secret you've got," Pyre told him coldly. "And your time is running out. Winward will start down the tower in three minutes, and I can't guarantee Link won't find his way underground even sooner."</p>
<a id="p4255" name="p4255"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4255)">It took the full three minutes and a little more, but in the end Kimmeron agreed.</p>
<a id="p4256" name="p4256"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4256)">&#160;</p>
