<h2 class="chapter">36</h2>

<p>Croaker did warn me. Be precise, he said. He warned me several
times, in fact.</p>

<p>I was ripped this way and dragged that, to and through the place
of blood and burning, papers browning, blackening, curling in such
slow motion. Blood pooled deep where I lay in my own vomit. The
slap of running feet was like the slow booming footfalls of
giants.</p>

<p>I heard screams that had no end.</p>

<p>Croaker warned me. I was thoughtless. What he did not tell me,
or maybe he did not understand, was that the concept
&ldquo;home&rdquo; could in one man&rsquo;s mind become defined by
emotional pain.</p>

<p>Torn. Shredded. Smoke took me to Taglios only for that minute in
the real now that is like the end of all time. I reeled and flung
away from there with such revulsion that I threw myself and the
hateful shreds and a disoriented Smoke all the way to Hell.</p>

<p>He had no will and no identity so he could not and did not laugh
as I floated down into the lake of pain.</p>

<p>Hell has a name. Its name is Dejagore. But Dejagore is only
Hell&rsquo;s lesser face.</p>

<p>From the greater Hell I escaped. One more time.</p>

<p>No identity and no will.</p>
<br>
<p><em>The wind blows but nothing moves in the place of glittering
stone. Night falls. The wind dies. The plain yields up its heat as
shadows waken. Moonlight settles upon the silence of stone.</em></p>

<p><em>The plain runs east and west, north and south, without
discernible bounds, viewed from within. Though its ends be
uncertain it has a definite center. That is an epic structure built
of the same stone as the pillars and plain.</em></p>

<p><em>Within that fastness nothing moves, either, though at times
mists of light shimmer as they leak over from beyond the gates of
dream. Shadows linger in corners. And way down inside the core of
the place, in the feeblest throb of the heart of darkness, there is
life of a sort.</em></p>
