<p>ROGER ZELAZNY is an expatriate Ohioan who now resides on a mountaintop in New Mexico
with his wife, Judy; sons Devin and Trent; daughter, Shannon; assorted typewriters,
oriental rugs, unanswered letters, and science fiction awards. The awards, which he keeps
close on hand in his office&#151;&quot;Never can tell when you might need one in a
hurry&quot;&#151;consist of three Hugs, three Nebulas, a Balrog, and the mystical presence
of the Prix Apollo. He has had 26 books published, and his works have been translated into
14 foreign languages, transcribed in Braille, and done as Talking Books. One of his novels
was made into a movie, and another has been sold for the same purpose. He is currently
working on a new novel. Also available in Signet editions are Roger Zelazny's fine novels,
Today We Choose Faces and Bridge of Ashes.</p>
