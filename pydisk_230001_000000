  <p>
   <br />Esther M. Friesner attended Vassar College and holds a Ph.D. from Yale University. She was severely criticized by her first college English teacher for choosing <i>Star Trek</i> as a subject for expository writing. (Hence we learn that Creative Writing does not always mean it, especially when it's listed in a college course catalog.) The author of nineteen published, fantasies, her most recent works include <i>Majyk by Accident, Majyk by Hook or Crook</i>, and <i>Majyk by Design</i>. She is also the editor of the <i>Alien Pregnant by Elvis!</i> Anthology. Her short stories have appeared in numerous anthologies and such magazines as <i>Asimov's, Fantasy and Science Fiction</i>, and <i>Amazing</i>. She lives in Connecticut with her husband, two children, two obstreperous cats, and as many hamsters as the market (and the cats) will bear.</p>
