<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Thirty-four: TO GHOJA</h2>

<p>It was worse than I thought it would be. The mud seemed
bottomless. The first day out of Taglios, after a cheering parade,
we made twelve miles. I did not feel desperate. But the road was
better nearer the city. After that it got worse. Eleven miles the
next day, nine each of the three days following. We made that good
a time only because we had the elephants along.</p>

<p>The day I wanted to reach the Ghoja ford I was still thirty
miles away.</p>

<p>Then Shifter came, wearing his wolf shape, prancing in out of
the wilds.</p>

<p>The rains had ended but the sky remained overcast, so the ground
did not dry. The sun was no ally.</p>

<p>Shifter came with a smaller companion. It looked as though his
understudy had caught on to shifting.</p>

<p>He spent an hour with Lady before we moved out. Then he galloped
away again.</p>

<p>Lady did not look cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst. They&rsquo;ve put one over on us,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not betray the sudden tightness in my innards.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recall the map of the Main. Between Numa and Ghoja
there&rsquo;s that low area that floods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pictured it. For twelve miles the river ran through an area
flanked by plains that flooded whenever the river rose more than a
few feet. At its highest stage it could be fourteen miles wide
there, with most of the flooding on the southern side. That plain
became a huge reservoir, and was the reason the Numa ford became
crossable before the Ghoja. But the last I&rsquo;d heard it was
mostly drained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. What about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since they took the south bank the Shadowmasters
have been building a levee, from the downriver end, right along the
normal bank. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been talked about
for ages. The Prahbrindrah wanted to do it, to claim the plain for
farming. But he couldn&rsquo;t afford the labor. The Shadowmasters
don&rsquo;t have that problem. They have fifty thousand prisoners
on it, Taglians who didn&rsquo;t get across the river last year and
enemies from their old territories. No one&rsquo;s paid any
attention because the project is one of those things that anyone
who could would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But. They&rsquo;ve gotten the levee run out eight miles
to the east. That&rsquo;s not as huge a deal as it sounds because
it only needs to be about ten feet tall. Every half mile they put
in a larger filled area, maybe a hundred fifty yards to a side,
like towers along a wall. They keep the prisoners camped there and
use the platforms for materials dumps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shifter noticed that they&rsquo;d stopped extending the
levee but they were still stockpiling materials. Then he figured it
out. They&rsquo;re going to dam the river, partially. Just enough
to divert water into the flood plain so they can drop the level at
the Ghoja ford sooner than we expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought about it. It was a cunning bit of business, and
entirely practical. The Company had done a trick or two with rivers
in its time. All it had to do was give them a day. If they got
across unchallenged we were sunk. &ldquo;The sneaky bastards. Can
we get there in time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Even probably, considering you didn&rsquo;t wait
to leave Taglios. But at the rate we&rsquo;re going it&rsquo;ll be
just barely in time and we&rsquo;ll be worn out from fighting the
mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they started damming yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They start that this morning, Shifter says. It should
take them two days to get the fill in and one more to divert enough
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it affect Numa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for a week. The water will keep dropping there for
now. Shifter&rsquo;s guess is they&rsquo;ll cross at Numa the day
before they do at Ghoja.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We looked at each other. She saw what I saw. The Shadowmasters
had robbed us of what we had in mind for the night before Ghoja.
&ldquo;Damn them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. This mud being what it is, I&rsquo;ll have to
leave today to get there in time. I probably won&rsquo;t get back
to Ghoja. Use Sindawe in our place. That town is a waste,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to move faster, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abandon the wagons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the engineers and quartermasters behind. Let them
make the best time they can. I&rsquo;ll leave them the elephants.
They&rsquo;re no good to me anyway. Have each man carry a little
extra. Whatever is most practical. Even the wagons might get there
in time if they skip stopping at Vejagehdya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Let&rsquo;s get at it.&rdquo; I
gathered my people and explained what we were going to do. An hour
later I watched Lady and the cavalry file away to the southeast.
Mogaba&rsquo;s grumbling infantrymen, each carrying an extra
fifteen pounds, started slogging toward Ghoja.</p>

<p>Even the old warlord carried a load.</p>

<p>I was glad I had had the luck or foresight to send out the bulk
of the stuff several days early.</p>

<p>I walked with the rest of them. My horse was carrying two
hundred pounds of junk and looking humiliated by the experience.
One-Eye grumbled along beside me. He had Frogface out scouting for
lines of advance where the earth would least resist our
passage.</p>

<p>I kept one eye on Lady. I felt hollow, empty. We&rsquo;d both
come to think of the night before the Ghoja battle as the night.
And now that would not be.</p>

<p>I suspected it would never be. There would always be something
to stand in the way. Maybe there were gods who frowned on our
admitting and consummating what we felt inside.</p>

<p>A pox on them and all their illegitimate children.</p>

<p>Someday, damnit. Someday.</p>

<p>But what then? Then we would have to give up a lot of pretense.
Then we&rsquo;d have to face some things, decide some things,
examine the possibilities and implications of some commitments.</p>

<p>I did not spend a lot of time thinking about saving Taglios that
day.</p>
