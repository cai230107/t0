             "You won a great victory," Carol said, held now in my  arms.  
        The great bulk of the Diana there floating over its reflection in 
        the  harbor.  We had repainted the hull where the  Imperial  mis-
        siles  had knocked the paint off.  Other than that, there was  no 
        visible  evidence  that  the Diana had ever been  in  battle.   I 
        looked down into my brownette's hazel eyes, felt the sweet curves 
        of her body against mine through the uniforms we both wore now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You  have given us `allies', `friends' halfway to  Alaska," 
        Queen Maris "smiled", standing there beside us, her eyes  bright.  
        I could hear the cheering of the people, the clang of the  gongs.  
        To everyone in Arsana this was the greatest victory they  knew...  
        To the people of Dularn I had actually "beat" Darlanis in battle!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The `end' of an era," I "answered", holding my wife  close.  
        In a few more years Dularn would be another "ruled" by Darlanis.  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "But we `WON'!" Queen Maris exclaimed, sensing my thoughts.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "So did Sitting Bull," I answered, seeing Carol nod in turn.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "The Empire can build battleships faster than we can," Carol 
        explained.  We had a "temporary" advantage over them now, but  we 
        both knew that would not last long.  I recalled Darlanis'  words.  
        We had "won" a battle, but she would in time "win" the war here.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "You were `in harm's way', weren't you?" Carol said to me as 
        I looked down at little Hope Simmons there in her crib, the  baby 
        happily cooing and making all those "noises" that a baby makes...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I felt pretty `safe' in the Diana," I smiled back at her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I fear for what the future holds now," Carol replied to me.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Darlanis  wants to have me take the Diana down  `south'  to 
        Mexico," I answered, looking down at Hope thoughtfully.   "`Sink' 
        the `Mexican Navy' for her so that she can make the Gulf of Cali-
        fornia  into an `Imperial lake' for her steam frigates."   I  saw 
        Carol nod, her hazel eyes burning into mine.  The Empress' "ambi-
        tions" knew no bounds.  She saw herself as a second Janet Rogers.  
        I knew Darlanis even made the claim (which no one supported) that 
        she was the "representative" of the old United States of America.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She believes sincerely that all of Mankind would be  better 
        off under her rule," my wife now said, standing there at my side.  
        Darlanis saw herself as "SHE-RA", as representative of the  GOOD.  
        Lorraine had once referred to her as "THE QUEEN OF LIGHT".   Even 
        in her description of God as she had seen Her there on Mars  Lor-
        raine had made the comparison of God as "looking like" Darlanis!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Judging from what we know, Janet Rogers was the same  way," 
        I answered, recalling what I'd read of her.  Unlike the dictators 
        of the 20th Century, Janet had been a warm, loving and benevolent 
        ruler of Mankind.  A "Big Sister" who watched out for everyone...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Maybe  we'd all be `better off' under Darlanis," Carol  re-
        plied thoughtfully.  "At least there wouldn't be any more wars."
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I  failed  you," I said to Tais as she stood  there  at  my 
        side, the lovely white marble city of Shalimar spreading out  be-
        fore us.  "Darlanis will eventually end up as Empress over all of 
        western North America despite anything Carol and I can do now."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She is not an evil woman," the First Priestess replied.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "But you didn't want her to be able to do this," I said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "We are not `infallible'," Tais smiled back at me then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She is truly a `Queen of Light'," I spoke thoughtfully.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She does live up to her moral standards," Tais observed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "And she keeps the caste codes," I added with a smile then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Lys asks little of us but that we keep her teachings,"  the 
        Priestess  smiled.  I was familiar with "THE BOOK OF  LYS",  with 
        its contents.  Unlike the "BIBLE" of Christians, Lys is a  merci-
        ful loving God who asks little of us but that we respect others.*
        
        * Apparently "Lys" does not "tolerate" other religions very much, 
        or is it the Priestesses of Lys who are "intolerant"?  I  suspect 
        that the "latter" is more likely the "truth" in this matter here.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "A copper for your thoughts," a woman's voice said to me  as 
        I sat there at the end of the dock, doing a little fishing along-
        side the Diana, a pair of beautiful azure eyes meeting mine as  I 
        looked up.  The Empress of California now giving me a warm smile.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "`A penny for your thoughts' back in my time," I smiled back 
        at her, the perfection of her well displayed by her golden mesh.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I am not unfamiliar with the phrase," Darlanis smiled, sit-
        ting  down  beside me, slipping off her boots so that  she  might 
        like  me soak her feet in the water, and adjusting her  skirt  so 
        that she didn't have to sit on the golden links that made it  up.  
        Like Carol and Californian women in general, she didn't have  the 
        "modesty taboos" that are more commonplace among Dularnian women.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Gold  doesn't  make that comfortable a dress, does  it?"  I 
        smiled in reply at her, the fish having so far ignored my worms.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It  does  rather  `pucker' the skin on my  rear  end,"  she 
        laughed back, the silver links about her throat reminding me that 
        she  was a married woman.  I have a "weakness" for  blondes,  and 
        Darlanis was certainly the "queen of blondes" in every sense too.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I hated having you as an `enemy'," I said to her then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I have suspected that for some time," she smiled back.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It is just as well that we are both married," I said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I was thinking the exact same thoughts," she admitted.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "It must be `hard' for you," I said to her, seeing her nod.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "He  has  `Pussycat' (a slave girl), while I  have  only  my 
        `hand',"  she answered, staring out over the still water  towards 
        the strait beyond.  I recalled hearing other women make much  the 
        same comment.  While most women do not have strong sexual drives, 
        those who do suffer badly from the "double standard" that allowed 
        married  men  to seek "relief" with prostitutes and  slave  girls 
        while denying their wives the same in return.  On the other  hand 
        sex for a woman is more an "emotional" experience than it is to a 
        man.  Carol says that "male prostitutes" wouldn't be "practical".  
        On the other hand does her "viewpoint" reflect that of all women?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Found yourself some `company'?" I heard Carol's voice  say, 
        the  clump of her boots there on the dock much like that  of  any 
        other woman's.  Women in this era having a "clip-clop" walk  just 
        like they did back in the Twentieth Century, doubtless due to the 
        fact that high heels are still just as popular now as back  then.  
        Kathi following close behind, a "Hefnerian" dream in her leather.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "`Checking  up' on your husband?" Darlanis  smiled,  getting 
        up, standing there barefooted before my wife.  The two women just 
        above the "same" in height right now with Carol in her 3" heels.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I don't have any `cause' for concern, do I?" Carol smiled.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Darlanis  and I were discussing the `double  standard',"  I 
        said, giving my wife a smile as I sat there "fishing", the  early 
        autumn  day pleasant and delightful.  The Diana would be  "ready" 
        for sea in another couple days, ready to take its long voyage  to 
        the south, where in the Gulf of California we would prove to  the 
        Imperial Mexican Navy the "destructiveness" of a "battleship"...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Which only proves that men still `rule' women," Carol said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Seems  hard to `believe' when every country from Alaska  to 
        Baja is `ruled' by a woman," I smiled back at my brownette wife.*
        
        *  Queen  Valeris  just south of Alaska,  Queen  Freydis  further 
        south, our own Queen Maris of Dularn, Queen Sharon of Orgon, Dar-
        lanis as Queen of Sarn and Empress of California, Queen  Lorraine 
        of  Trelandar, Queen Dala Dai of Talon.  Baja is ruled by  Tara's 
        son,  Prince Jers, but his wife Lara has much to "say" about  it.  
        The  Nevadas and Wyomings are "ruled" by men, but they  are  also 
        "barbarians" and not considered "civilized" by any one now living 
        in the societies that make up the western coast of North America.
        
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Only in Valeris' lands do women actually `rule',"  Darlanis 
        said.  I supposed it was true as far as it went.  I recalled that 
        men of this time had "drawn a line" that no woman dared  "cross".  
        Everyone in Dularn still recalled the name of "mad" Queen Kathis, 
        who was dragged from her palace by an enraged mob and hung in the 
        public square!  Her sucessor had been Tulis, who most believed to 
        be the mother of Darlanis.  No Queen since had dared go as far in 
        the  "cause" of women.  Maris' outlawing of slave  raids  against 
        other countries really had been "accepted" as a means of  keeping 
        peace  with the Empire than anything else.  It had not  had  much 
        effect upon the supply of slave girls flowing into Dularn either!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "And she is a `dead end'," Carol commented, slipping off her 
        own boots, her obvious intention being to join me there  fishing.  
        I recalled what Tais had "said".  It was just as well that  Queen 
        Valeris had "obeyed" Darlanis' orders.  Otherwise she would  have 
        "faced" a great gleaming cylinder floating in the sky, its  laser 
        turrets dealing death and destruction like the "wrath" of a god!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Some  things `change', some things remain the `same',"  the 
        Empress of California smiled, her wet feet leaving marks there on 
        the dock.  Carol giving me a kiss and a smile as she plopped her-
        self down beside me, pulling her pants up as high as she could so 
        that she might wet her own feet in the cool waters of the harbor.  
        Darlanis whispering something to Kathi, who then followed her...
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I  might mention at this point, having "neglected" to do  so 
        before for some reason that my wife has had considerable  "influ-
        ence" on clothing styles here in Arsana since our arrival here in 
        2567.   Her  "fashion business" is extremely  "profitable",  (she 
        does do the "designs") enough so that one of the Senators in  the 
        Senate recently questioned the fact whether my wife was  actually 
        paying enough "attention" to her duties as the Warlady of Dularn!  
        As I mentioned in my previous book Carol did have a "fashion bus-
        iness"  in the 20th Century, and while it was not something  that 
        made  us "rich", Carol did make a decent profit from it.  On  the 
        other hand the one she has "here" in Arsana has given us such  an 
        income that it now equals the pay we receive from the government.  
        (This is why you now see teen age Dularnian girls in miniskirts.)
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I think you could `fall' for `that'," Carol said to me.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "She is a very beautiful woman," I admitted to my wife.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "And she uses that `beauty' to her advantage," she said.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Maybe there is a `second Janet Rogers'," I said to Carol.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "I'm going with you on the Diana," my wife said to me then.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Perhaps to `keep an eye' on your `property'?" I teased her.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             "Especially when there is a `blonde' like her around," Carol 
        answered, giving me a smile, a delightful twinkle in her eyes...
