<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Thirty-two: SHADOWLIGHT</h2>

<p>The Shadowmasters met in a haste that left them exhausted. The
meet had been set days earlier but as they travelled a cry had gone
out saying it was too late for lazy, comfortable movements.</p>

<p>They were in the place of the pool and uncertain dimensions and
shadows. The woman bobbed restlessly. Her companion was agitated.
The one who spoke seldom spoke first. &ldquo;What is the
panic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our resources in Taglios have been exterminated. All but
the newest. As suddenly as that.&rdquo; She snapped her
fingers.</p>

<p>Her companion said, &ldquo;They are about to march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman: &ldquo;They knew who our resources were. Which means
everything we learned through them is suspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her companion: &ldquo;We have to move sooner than we planned. We
cannot give them a minute more than we must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quiet one asked, &ldquo;Have we been found out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman: &ldquo;No. We have the one resource close to the
heart, still undetected if mostly ineffective. It hasn&rsquo;t
reported a hint of a suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should join the troops. We should leave nothing to the
hazard of battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve argued this out already. No. We will not risk
ourselves. There is no cause to think they will have any chance
against our veterans. I have added five thousand men to the
invasion force. That is enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was another thing. The thing you called us here to
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Our comrade of Shadowcatch and Overlook is not as
southward obsessed as he would have us think. He infiltrated some
of his people into Taglian territory the past year. They attacked
the leaders of the Black Company. And failed abysmally. Their
efforts served only one purpose&mdash;beyond betraying his thinking. They
gave me a chance to insinuate our one surviving resource into the
enemy fold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then when next we meet him we can mock him in
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. If it seems appropriate. One piece of news comes
out of his effort. Dorotea Senjak is with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A long stillness followed. Finally, the one who spoke so seldom
observed, &ldquo;That alone explains why our friend would send men
north secretly. How dearly he would love to own her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The female replied, &ldquo;For more reasons than the obvious.
There appears to be a relationship with the Company&rsquo;s
Captain. She would be a valuable resource if that relationship is
strong enough to be manipulated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be killed as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! We must capture her. If he can use her, so can we.
Think what she knows. What she was. She might hold the key to
ridding the world of him and of closing the gateway. She may be
powerless but she has not lost her memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who spoke seldom began to laugh. His laughter was as
insane as that heard in Overlook. He was thinking anyone could use
the memories of Dorotea Senjak. Anyone!</p>

<p>The female recognized that laugh, understood what was happening
in his mind, knew she and her companion would have to proceed very
carefully. But she pretended not to see. She asked her companion,
&ldquo;Have you contacted the one in the swamps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants nothing to do with us or our troubles. He is
content with his fetid, humid little empire. But he will come
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. We&rsquo;re agreed? We advance the
schedule?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heads nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send the orders immediately.&rdquo;</p>
