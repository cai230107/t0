<a id="p180" name="p180"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(180)" >God was chuckling as he strolled back to his secretary's desk.</p>
<a id="p181" name="p181"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(181)" >"I've got it," he said. He handed the secretary a beautiful scroll and said, "Key this in and send it on the Hotline straight to Hell. Make sure it's perfect when you send it&#151;I don't want those fiends finding any loopholes I didn't intend." He chuckled. "I expect they'll cause quite enough trouble making use of the few I did intend."</p>
<a id="p182" name="p182"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(182)" >The angel unrolled the scroll and began to read. Its eyes went huge and round and it said, "Your Holiness . . . are you serious?"</p>
<a id="p183" name="p183"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(183)" >"Oh, certainly. I haven't done any miracles in ages . . . they've been too busy doing miracles of their own. Space travel, television, electronics, medicine . . . they've been very busy. But I think a miracle they can't ignore and can't debunk will be a lot of fun."</p>
<a id="p184" name="p184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(184)" >"But don't you think this will give . . . er . . . <i>him</i> an edge?"</p>
<a id="p185" name="p185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(185)" >God rested a hand on the angel's shoulder and said, "Evil never has the edge it thinks it has. People will surprise you. They certainly surprise me, even now. No, I think this will shake loose some people who have been growing complacent. It will wake my children up." He chuckled again. "Besides, I haven't allowed myself the pleasure of seeing that miserable old goat dance to my tune in years. I think this is the sort of tune that will get him stepping, don't you?"</p>
<a id="p186" name="p186"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(186)" >"Oh, yes," the angel said, staring at the long scroll covered with Lucifer's marching orders. "I certainly do."</p>
