<h2 class="chapter">42</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Got something for you, Kid.&rdquo; I started awake.
&ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; What happened? I
don&rsquo;t drift off that way.</p>

<p>One-Eye had a big shit-eating grin on but it evaporated when he
looked at me closer. He darted in, grabbed my chin, turned my head
right and left. &ldquo;You just have one of your spells?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spells?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not exactly. I just had their word for the fact that I went
spooky sometimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a kind of psychic shimmer. Maybe I
caught you just in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He and Goblin kept talking about doing experiments to find out
what is happening but there never seemed to be time to actually do
anything. &ldquo;What do you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work parties broke into the old catacombs this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Longo told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s charging around in there, all
excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine. Find any treasure yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One-Eye looked put-upon. For such a blackhearted toad he can
manage a truly impressive show of self-righteous injury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found some books. A whole pile. All sealed up neat and
everything. Looks like they&rsquo;ve been there since the
Shadowmasters first came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes sense since they always burned the books and the
priests. You find any priests lurking down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not hardly. Look, I got to get back.&rdquo; Before
somebody grabbed a treasure out from under him, no doubt. &ldquo;I
got a couple guys lugging them books up for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gods forfend you should have lifted anything
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got a serious attitude problem, Kid. I&rsquo;m an old
man.&rdquo; One-Eye did a fade. He has that knack when he is about
to find himself in an indefensible position.</p>

<p>A city seldom is buttoned up so tight that no news gets in from
outside. Sometimes it seems almost mystical but the word does come
through. In Dejagore rumor seldom brought in anything Mogaba wanted
to hear.</p>

<p>I was studying the discovered books, so intrigued I was letting
duties slide. They were written in Jaicuri but the written form
thereof is almost identical to written Taglian.</p>

<p>Goblin stepped in. &ldquo;You doing all right? No more
dizziness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You guys worry too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t. Look, some new rumors are going
around. There&rsquo;s supposedly a relief column headed our way.
Blade, of all people, is in charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blade? He
isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s never run anything
bigger than a reduced company. Before we ever got here. Fighting
guerrilla style against amateurs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make them up, I just report them. He did do
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did Willow Swan and Cordy Mather. But that
was accident and luck and Shadowlander stupidity more than anything
those three actually did. Why on earth is he commanding an
army?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposedly Lady&rsquo;s second in command. Not
much doubt anymore that she survived. She&rsquo;s also pissed off.
And putting together a new army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet Mogaba&rsquo;s jumping for joy. Running around
hollering, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re saved! We&rsquo;re
saved!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might say he&rsquo;s
jumping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the following few days we heard a thousand wild stories. If
a tenth were true some really bizarre changes were underway out
there in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard the latest?&rdquo; Goblin asked me one night
when I took a rare break from the books to examine that outer world
from the wall. &ldquo;Lady ain&rsquo;t Lady after all. She&rsquo;s
the incarnation of some goddess named Kina. A real badass, too,
apparently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would be. Thai Dei. You know Kina, don&rsquo;t you?
Tell us about her.&rdquo; Thai Dei wasn&rsquo;t allowed into our
warrens but he always turned up whenever I came up for air.</p>

<p>He forgot all three words of Taglian he had admitted to knowing.
The name of that goddess scrubbed his brain clean.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happens when you mention Kina
to any of these people. I can&rsquo;t even get our prisoners to
talk about her. You would think she belonged to the Black
Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be a real charmer,&rdquo; Bucket
opined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is. She is. There&rsquo;s one.&rdquo; I
meant a shooting star. We were keeping count. Also of enemy
watchfires. The southerners had scattered in small unit encampments
around the plain recently. I guess they were afraid we might sneak
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know something about her, then?&rdquo; Goblin
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From those books you guys found.&rdquo; The men were
bitter. The books and some sealed jars filled with grain were the
only treasures they unearthed. The Gunni were the majority religion
in Jaicur and the Gunni do not bury their dead. They burn them. The
minority Vehdna do bury their dead but do not include any grave
goods. Where their dead are bound they have no need of luggage. In
paradise everything is provided. In hell, too. &ldquo;One was a
compilation of Gunni myths, in variants from all over. The guy who
recorded them was a religious scholar. His book wasn&rsquo;t meant
to get out where it might confuse ordinary people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused and there ain&rsquo;t nothing ordinary about
me,&rdquo; Bucket observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the scoop, Murgen? How come they
won&rsquo;t tell us about this bitch? Whoa! Did you see that one?
It exploded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;The Gunni religion
is the most common one around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we know that, Murgen,&rdquo; Goblin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just making the point. Most people down here believe in
Kina. Even if they&rsquo;re not Gunni, they believe. Here&rsquo;s
the story. The Gunni have Lords of Light and Lords of Darkness.
They&rsquo;ve been doing their lording since the beginning of
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like standard stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is. Only the value systems are different from what we
knew back home. The balance between darkness and light is more
dynamic here, and isn&rsquo;t weighted the same emotionally as our
struggle between good and evil. Moreover, Kina is a sort of
self-elevated outside agency of decay and corruption that attacks
both darkness and light. She was created by the Lords of Light to
help defeat a horde of really nasty demons they couldn&rsquo;t
handle any other way. She helped by eating the demons. Naturally,
she got fat. And apparently wanted dessert because she tried to eat
everybody else, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was stronger than the gods who created her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guys, I didn&rsquo;t make this stuff up. Don&rsquo;t ask me
to rationalize it. Goblin, you&rsquo;ve been everywhere. You ever
seen a religion that can&rsquo;t be picked to shreds by any
nonbeliever with brains enough to tie his own bootlaces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goblin shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as cynical as Croaker
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah? Good for me. Anyway, there&rsquo;s a lot
of typically murky mythological stuff about mothers and fathers and
vicious, hideous, probably incestuous carryings-on amongst the
other gods while Kina kept getting stronger. She was real sneaky.
That&rsquo;s one of her attributes. Deceit. But then her main
creator, or father, tricked her and put a sleep spell on her.
She&rsquo;s still snoring away somewhere but she can touch our
world through her dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got her worshippers. All Gunni deities do.
Big, little, good, bad, indifferent, they all have their temples
and priesthoods. I can&rsquo;t find out much about Kina&rsquo;s
followers. They&rsquo;re called Deceivers. The soldiers won&rsquo;t
talk about them. They flat refuse, like naming Kina might actually
waken her. Which, I gather, is the holy mission of her
worshippers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too weird for me,&rdquo; Bucket
grumbled. Goblin said, &ldquo;That explains why Lady scares the
shit out of everybody whenever she dresses up. If they really think
she&rsquo;s turned into this goddess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I figure we should find out everything we can about this
Kina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crack plan, Murgen. How? If nobody will talk?&rdquo;
Yeah. Even the boldest Taglians threatened to get the vapors if I
pressed. It was obvious that they were not just terrified of this
goddess. They were scared of me, too.</p>

<p>One-Eye brought heartening news. &ldquo;This stuff about the
relief force is gold, boss. Every night now Spinner is sneaking
troops out through the hills like he don&rsquo;t think we can see
them go if it&rsquo;s dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could he be giving up the siege?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The troops are all headed north. Home ain&rsquo;t
north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not offer another alternative. One-Eye would not have come
if he was not sure.</p>

<p>Of course, One-Eye being sure never meant that One-Eye was
right. He was One-Eye.</p>

<p>I thanked him, sent him to do a small chore, found Goblin and
asked him what he thought. The little wizard seemed surprised I
would bother. &ldquo;Did One-Eye stutter or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But he&rsquo;s One-Eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goblin could not contain his big frog grin. That made perfect
sense to him.</p>

<p>Nobody relayed the news to Mogaba. I thought it would go easier
for everybody if he didn&rsquo;t know. But Mogaba heard rumors,
too.</p>

<p>Dejagore was a nightmare town filled with factions only loosely
united in defiance of the besiegers. Mogaba&rsquo;s forces were the
strongest. The Jaicuri were most numerous. We Old Crew, with our
auxiliaries, were less numerous and less powerful. But boy were we
strong in our righteousness.</p>

<p>And then there were the Nyueng Bao. The Nyueng Bao remained an
enigma.</p>
