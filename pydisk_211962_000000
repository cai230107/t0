<h2 class="chapter">LXII</h2>

<p>With a little sorcery and a little luck Bomanz learned that the
men Exile had sent for the valuable corporal had just gone to
Nightstalker headquarters and told them to produce him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like getting somebody else to do your work for
you,&rdquo; Raven said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a fine idea to me,&rdquo; Bomanz said.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we find a place and wait for them to bring
him to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As easily done as said. There was just one decent,
straightforward route running from the Nightstalkers&rsquo;
headquarters to the heart of Oar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally coming,&rdquo; Bomanz said. &ldquo;Silent. Lay
down that haze now. Don&rsquo;t make it so thick they smell
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silent walked a ways away, just kind of stood there. People
passing looked at him and stayed as far away as they could. Soon
there was a stronger than normal smell of woodsmoke. The air grew
hazy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is them,&rdquo; Bomanz said of a tight little group
approaching.</p>

<p>As the group came abreast the haze suddenly thickened. Bomanz
struck at the escort of four men, flattened them, called his
favorite buzzard in to dispose of their allegiance badges.</p>

<p>The four had been escorting a man and a woman. Silent looked at
the female and started signing so fast only Raven could follow him.
&ldquo;Brigadier Wildbrand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have to take
her, too. You don&rsquo;t refuse a gift from the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite their apparel they got into the Gartsen stable without
attracting attention. Wizards were handy sometimes. Raven asked the
man who met them, Gartsen, &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raven stepped around a small menhir, climbed, made signs
one-handed.</p>

<p>Neither the corporal nor Wildbrand had said a word yet. They had
no real idea what their situation was. Till Darling came to look
them over. Wildbrand recognized her. The Brigadier said, &ldquo;Oh,
shit. It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bomanz said, &ldquo;Tell Darling we&rsquo;re ready to go get the
rest of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silent&rsquo;s hands were fluttering. He ignored the old wizard.
He asked Darling, &ldquo;Did you talk to the tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered his signs, &ldquo;Yes. He is troubled. He suggests
we remove Case from that camp. Something happened there, involving
Case, that he has heard of from his creatures. We will shackle
these two and leave them with Gartsen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silent started arguing. She donned the clothing of one of
Exile&rsquo;s guards. Sometimes she used her handicap for all it
was worth. As when she did not want to argue.</p>

<p>Silent and Raven were livid. Neither one believed the tree had
mentioned Case at all.</p>
