<h2 class="chapter">DAVOS</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or a moment it seemed as though the king had not heard. Stannis
showed no pleasure at the news, no anger, no disbelief, not even
relief. He stared at his Painted Table with teeth clenched hard.
&ldquo;You are certain?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not seeing the body, no, Your Kingliness,&rdquo;
said Salladhor Saan. &ldquo;Yet in the city, the lions prance and
dance. <em>The Red Wedding</em>, the smallfolk are calling it. They swear
Lord Frey had the boy&rsquo;s head hacked off, sewed the head of
his direwolf in its place, and nailed a crown about his ears. His
lady mother was slain as well, and thrown naked in the
river.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>At a wedding</em>, thought Davos. <em>As he sat at his slayer&rsquo;s
board, a guest beneath his roof. These Freys are cursed</em>. He could
smell the burning blood again, and hear the leech hissing and
spitting on the brazier&rsquo;s hot coals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the Lord&rsquo;s wrath that slew him,&rdquo; Ser
Axell Florent declared. &ldquo;It was the hand of
R&rsquo;hllor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Praise the Lord of Light!</em>&rdquo; sang out Queen Selyse, a
pinched thin hard woman with large ears and a hairy upper lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the hand of R&rsquo;hllor spotted and palsied?&rdquo;
asked Stannis. &ldquo;This sounds more Walder Frey&rsquo;s
handiwork than any god&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;R&rsquo;hllor chooses such instruments as he
requires.&rdquo; The ruby at Melisandre&rsquo;s throat shone redly.
&ldquo;His ways are mysterious, but no man may withstand his fiery
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No man may withstand him!</em>&rdquo; the queen cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, woman. You are not at a nightfire now.&rdquo;
Stannis considered the Painted Table. &ldquo;The wolf leaves no
heirs, the kraken too many. The lions will devour them
unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Saan, I will require your fastest
ships to carry envoys to the Iron Islands and White Harbor. I shall
offer pardons.&rdquo; The way he snapped his teeth showed how
little he liked that word. &ldquo;Full pardons, for all those who
repent of treason and swear fealty to their rightful king. They
must see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not.&rdquo; Melisandre&rsquo;s voice was soft.
&ldquo;I am sorry, Your Grace. This is not an end. More false kings
will soon rise to take up the crowns of those who&rsquo;ve
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More?&rdquo; Stannis looked as though he would gladly
have throttled her. &ldquo;More usurpers? <em>More</em> traitors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen it in the flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Queen Selyse went to the king&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;The Lord of
Light sent Melisandre to guide you to your glory. Heed her, I beg
you. R&rsquo;hllor&rsquo;s holy flames do not lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are lies and lies, woman. Even when these flames
speak truly, they are full of tricks, it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ant who hears the words of a king may not comprehend
what he is saying,&rdquo; Melisandre said, &ldquo;and all men are
ants before the fiery face of god. If sometimes I have mistaken a
warning for a prophecy or a prophecy for a warning, the fault lies
in the reader, not the book. But this I know for a certainty&mdash;envoys and pardons will not serve you now, no more than leeches.
You must show the realm a sign. A sign that proves your
power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Power?</em>&rdquo; The king snorted. &ldquo;I have thirteen
hundred men on Dragonstone, another three hundred at Storm&rsquo;s
End.&rdquo; His hand swept over the Painted Table. &ldquo;The rest
of Westeros is in the hands of my foes. I have no fleet but
Salladhor Saan&rsquo;s. No coin to hire sellswords. No prospect of
plunder or glory to lure freeriders to my cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord husband,&rdquo; said Queen Selyse, &ldquo;you have
more men than Aegon did three hundred years ago. All you lack are
dragons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look Stannis gave her was dark. &ldquo;Nine mages crossed
the sea to hatch Aegon the Third&rsquo;s cache of eggs. Baelor the
Blessed prayed over his for half a year. Aegon the Fourth built
dragons of wood and iron. Aerion Brightflame drank wildfire to
transform himself. The mages failed, King Baelor&rsquo;s prayers
went unanswered, the wooden dragons burned, and Prince Aerion died
screaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Queen Selyse was adamant. &ldquo;None of these was the chosen of
R&rsquo;hllor. No red comet blazed across the heavens to herald
their coming. None wielded Lightbringer, the red sword of heroes.
And none of them paid the price. Lady Melisandre will tell you, my
lord. Only death can pay for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy?&rdquo; The king almost spat the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy,&rdquo; agreed the queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy,&rdquo; Ser Axell echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sick unto death of this wretched boy before he was
even born,&rdquo; the king complained. &ldquo;His very name is a roaring
in my ears and a dark cloud upon my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the boy to me and you need never hear his name
spoken again,&rdquo; Melisandre promised.</p>

<p><em>No, but you&rsquo;ll hear him screaming when she burns him</em>. Davos
held his tongue. It was wiser not to speak until the king commanded
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the boy for R&rsquo;hllor,&rdquo; the red woman
said, &ldquo;and the ancient prophecy shall be fulfilled. Your
dragon shall awaken and spread his stony wings. The kingdom shall
be yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Axell went to one knee. &ldquo;On bended knee I beg you,
sire. Wake the stone dragon and let the traitors tremble. Like
Aegon you begin as Lord of Dragonstone. Like Aegon you shall
conquer. Let the false and the fickle feel your flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own wife begs as well, lord husband.&rdquo; Queen
Selyse went down on both knees before the king, hands clasped as if
in prayer. &ldquo;Robert and Delena defiled our bed and laid a
curse upon our union. This boy is the foul fruit of their
fomications. Lift his shadow from my womb and I will bear you many
trueborn sons, I know it.&rdquo; She threw her arms around his
legs. &ldquo;He is only one boy, born of your brother&rsquo;s lust
and my cousin&rsquo;s shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is mine own blood. Stop clutching me, woman.&rdquo;
King Stannis put a hand on her shoulder, awkwardly untangling
himself from her grasp. &ldquo;Perhaps Robert did curse our
marriage bed. He swore to me that he never meant to shame me, that
he was drunk and never knew which bedchamber he entered that night.
But does it matter? The boy was not at fault, whatever the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melisandre put her hand on the king&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;The
Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more
precious. From his king&rsquo;s blood and his untainted fire, a
dragon shall be born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stannis did not pull away from Melisandre&rsquo;s touch as he
had from his queen&rsquo;s. The red woman was all Selyse was not;
young, full-bodied, and strangely beautiful, with her heart-shaped
face, coppery hair, and unearthly red eyes. &ldquo;It would be a
wondrous thing to see stone come to life,&rdquo; he admitted,
grudging. &ldquo;And to mount a dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
remember the first time my father took me to court, Robert had to
hold my hand. I could not have been older than four, which would
have made him five or six. We agreed afterward that the king had
been as noble as the dragons were fearsome.&rdquo; Stannis snorted.
&ldquo;Years later, our father told us that Aerys had cut himself
on the throne that morning, so his Hand had taken his place. It was
Tywin Lannister who&rsquo;d so impressed us.&rdquo; His fingers
touched the surface of the table, tracing a path lightly across the
varnished hills. &ldquo;Robert took the skulls down when he donned
the crown, but he could not bear to have them destroyed. Dragon
wings over Westeros&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there would be such
a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Your Grace!</em>&rdquo; Davos edged forward. &ldquo;Might I
speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stannis closed his mouth so hard his teeth snapped. &ldquo;My
lord of the Rainwood. Why do you think I made you Hand, if not to
speak?&rdquo; The king waved a hand. &ldquo;Say what you
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Warrior, make me brave</em>. &ldquo;I know little of dragons and less
of gods&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but the queen spoke of curses. No
man is as cursed as the kinslayer, in the eyes of gods and
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no gods save R&rsquo;hllor and the Other, whose
name must not be spoken.&rdquo; Melisandre&rsquo;s mouth made a
hard red line. &ldquo;And small men curse what they cannot
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a small man,&rdquo; Davos admitted, &ldquo;so tell
me why you need this boy Edric Storm to wake your great stone
dragon, my lady.&rdquo; He was determined to say the boy&rsquo;s
name as often as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only death can pay for life, my lord. A great gift
requires a great sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the greatness in a baseborn child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has kings&rsquo; blood in his veins. You have seen
what even a little of that blood could do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you burn some leeches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And two false kings are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robb Stark was murdered by Lord Walder of the Crossing,
and we have heard that Balon Greyjoy fell from a bridge. Who did
your leeches kill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt the power of R&rsquo;hllor?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>No</em>. Davos remembered too well the living shadow that had
squirmed from out her womb that night beneath Storm&rsquo;s End,
its black hands pressing at her thighs. <em>I must go carefully here,
or some shadow may come seeking me as well</em>. &ldquo;Even an onion
smuggler knows two onions from three. You are short a king, my
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stannis gave a snort of laughter. &ldquo;He has you there, my
lady. Two is not three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Your Grace. One king might die by chance,
even two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but three? if Joffrey should die
in the midst of all his power, surrounded by his armies and his
Kingsguard, would not that show the power of the Lord at
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might.&rdquo; The king spoke as if he grudged each
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or not.&rdquo; Davos did his best to hide his fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joffrey <em>shall</em> die,&rdquo; Queen Selyse declared, serene
in her confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be that he is dead already,&rdquo; Ser Axell
added.</p>

<p>Stannis looked at them with annoyance. &ldquo;Are you trained
crows, to croak at me in turns? Enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband, hear me&mdash;&rdquo; the queen entreated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Two is not three. Kings can count as well as
smugglers. You may go.&rdquo; Stannis turned his back on them.</p>

<p>Melisandre helped the queen to her feet. Selyse swept stiffly
from the chamber, the red woman trailing behind. Ser Axell lingered
long enough to give Davos one last look. <em>An ugly look on an ugly
face</em>, he thought as he met the stare.</p>

<p>After the others had gone, Davos cleared his throat. The king
looked up. &ldquo;Why are you still here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, about Edric
Storm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stannis made a sharp gesture. &ldquo;Spare me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davos persisted. &ldquo;Your daughter takes her lessons with
him, and plays with him every day in Aegon&rsquo;s
Garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her heart would break if anything ill should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would only see him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen him. He looks like Robert. Aye, and worships
him. Shall I tell him how often his beloved father ever gave him a
thought? My brother liked the making of children well enough, but
after birth they were a bother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asks after you every day, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are making me angry, Davos. I will hear no more of
this bastard boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Edric Storm, sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know his name. Was there ever a name so apt? It
proclaims his bastardy, his high birth, and the turmoil he brings
with him. Edric Storm. There, I have said it. Are you satisfied, my
lord Hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edric&mdash;&rdquo; he started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;<em>is one boy!</em> He may be the best boy who ever drew
breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm.&rdquo; His
hand swept across the Painted Table. &ldquo;How many boys dwell in
Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The
darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends.
She talks of prophecies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a hero reborn in
the sea, living dragons hatched from dead
stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she speaks of signs and swears they
point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be
king. Yet dare I disregard her?&rdquo; He ground his teeth.
&ldquo;We do not choose our destinies. Yet we
must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we must do our duty, no? Great or
small, <em>we must do our duty</em>. Melisandre swears that she has seen me
in her flames, facing the dark with Lightbringer raised on high.
<em>Lightbringer!</em>&rdquo; Stannis gave a derisive snort. &ldquo;It
glimmers prettily, I&rsquo;ll grant you, but on the Blackwater this magic sword
served me no better than any common steel. A dragon would have
turned that battle. Aegon once stood here as I do, looking down on
this table. Do you think we would name him Aegon the Conqueror
today if he had not had <em>dragons?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; said Davos, &ldquo;the cost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I know the cost!</em> Last night, gazing into that hearth, I
saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on
his brows, burning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>burning</em>, Davos. His
own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash. Do you think
I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or <em>you?</em>&rdquo; The
king moved, so his shadow fell upon King&rsquo;s Landing. &ldquo;If
Joffrey should die&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what is the life of
one bastard boy against a kingdom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Davos, softly.</p>

<p>Stannis looked at him, jaw clenched. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; the king
said at last, &ldquo;before you talk yourself back into the
dungeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes the storm winds blow so strong a man has no choice but
to furl his sails. &ldquo;Aye, Your Grace.&rdquo; Davos bowed, but
Stannis had seemingly forgotten him already.</p>

<p>It was chilly in the
yard when he left the Stone Drum. A wind blew briskly from the
cast, making the banners snap and flap noisily along the walls.
Davos could smell salt in the air. <em>The sea</em>. He loved that smell. It
made him want to walk a deck again, to raise his canvas and sail
off south to Marya and his two small ones. He thought of them most
every day now, and even more at night. Part of him wanted nothing
so much as to take Devan and go home. <em>I cannot. Not yet. I am a
lord now, and the King&rsquo;s Hand, I must not fail him</em>.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to gaze up at the walls. In place of merlons,
a thousand grotesques and gargoyles looked down on him, each
different from all the others; wyvems, griffins, demons,
manticores, minotaurs, basilisks, hellhounds, cockatrices, and a
thousand queerer creatures sprouted from the castle&rsquo;s
battlements as if they&rsquo;d grown there. And the dragons were
everywhere. The Great Hall was a dragon lying on its belly. Men
entered through its open mouth. The kitchens were a dragon curled
up in a ball, with the smoke and steam of the ovens vented through
its nostrils. The towers were dragons hunched above the walls or
poised for flight; the Windwyrm seemed to scream defiance, while
Sea Dragon Tower gazed serenely out across the waves. Smaller
dragons framed the gates. Dragon claws emerged from walls to grasp
at torches, great stone wings enfolded the smith and armory, and
tails formed arches, bridges, and exterior stairs.</p>

<p>Davos had often heard it said that the wizards of Valyria did
not cut and chisel as common masons did, but worked stone with fire
and magic as a potter might work clay. But now he wondered. <em>What if
they were real dragons, somehow turned to stone?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;If the red woman brings them to life, the castle will
come crashing down, I am thinking. What kind of dragons are full of
rooms and stairs and furniture? And windows. And chimneys. And
privy shafts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davos turned to find Salladhor Saan beside him. &ldquo;Does this
mean you have forgiven my treachery, Salla?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old pirate wagged a finger at him. &ldquo;Forgiving, yes.
Forgetting, no. All that good gold on Claw Isle that might have
been mine, it makes me old and tired to think of it. When I die
impoverished, my wives and concubines will curse you, Onion Lord.
Lord Celtigar had many fine wines that now I am not tasting, a sea
eagle he had trained to fly from the wrist, and a magic horn to
summon krakens from the deep. Very useful such a horn would be, to
pull down Tyroshi and other vexing creatures. But do I have this
horn to blow? No, because the king made my old friend his
Hand.&rdquo; He slipped his arm through Davos&rsquo;s and said,
&ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s men love you not, old friend. I am hearing
that a certain Hand has been making friends of his own. This is
true, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>You hear too much, you old pirate</em>. A smuggler had best know men
as well as tides, or he would not live to smuggle long. The
queen&rsquo;s men might remain fervent followers of the Lord of
Light, but the lesser folk of Dragonstone were drifting back to the
gods they&rsquo;d known all their lives. They said Stannis was
ensorceled, that Melisandre had turned him away from the Seven to
bow before some demon out of shadow,
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;worst sin of
all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that she and her god had failed him.
And there were knights and lordlings who felt the same. Davos had
sought them out, choosing them with the same care with which
he&rsquo;d once picked his crews. Ser Gerald Gower fought stoutly
on the Blackwater, but afterward had been heard to say that
R&rsquo;hllor must be a feeble god to let his followers be chased
off by a dwarf and a dead man. Ser Andrew Estermont was the
king&rsquo;s cousin, and had served as his squire years ago. The
Bastard of Nightsong had commanded the rearguard that allowed
Stannis to reach the safety of Salladhor Saan&rsquo;s galleys, but
he worshiped the Warrior with a faith as fierce as he was.
<em>King&rsquo;s men, not queen&rsquo;s men</em>. But it would not do to
boast of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A certain Lysene pirate once told me that a good smuggler
stays out of sight,&rdquo; Davos replied carefully. &ldquo;Black
sails, muffled oars, and a crew that knows how to hold their
tongues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lyseni laughed. &ldquo;A crew with no tongues is even
better. Big strong mutes who cannot read or write.&rdquo; But then
he grew more somber. &ldquo;But I am glad to know that someone
watches your back, old friend. Will the king give the boy to the
red priestess, do you think? One little dragon could end this great
big war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old habit made him reach for his luck, but his fingerbones no
longer hung about his neck, and he found nothing. &ldquo;He will
not do it,&rdquo; said Davos. &ldquo;He could not harm his own
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Renly will be glad to hear this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Renly was a traitor in arms. Edric Storm is innocent of
any crime. His Grace is a just man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salla shrugged. &ldquo;We shall be seeing. Or you shall. For
myself, I am returning to sea. Even now, rascally smugglers may be
sailing across the Blackwater Bay, hoping to avoid paying their
lord&rsquo;s lawful duties.&rdquo; He slapped Davos on the back.
&ldquo;Take care. You with your mute friends. You are grown so very
great now, yet the higher a man climbs the farther he has to
fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davos reflected on those words as he climbed the steps of Sea
Dragon Tower to the maester&rsquo;s chambers below the rookery. He
did not need Salla to tell him that he had risen too high. <em>I cannot
read, I cannot write, the lords despise me, I know nothing of
ruling, how can I be the King&rsquo;s Hand? I belong on the deck of
a ship, not in a castle tower</em>.</p>

<p>He had said as much to Maester Pylos. &ldquo;You are a notable
captain,&rdquo; the maester replied. &ldquo;A captain rules his
ship, does he not? He must navigate treacherous waters, set his
sails to catch the rising wind, know when a storm is coming and how
best to weather it. This is much the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pylos meant it kindly, but his assurances rang hollow. &ldquo;It
is not at all the same!&rdquo; Davos had protested. &ldquo;A
kingdom&rsquo;s not a ship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and a good
thing, or this kingdom would be sinking. I know wood and rope and
water, yes, but how will that serve me now? Where do I find the
wind to blow King Stannis to his throne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maester laughed at that. &ldquo;And there you have it, my
lord. Words are wind, you know, and you&rsquo;ve blown mine away
with your good sense. His Grace knows what he has in you, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Onions,&rdquo; said Davos glumly. &ldquo;That is what he
has in me. The King&rsquo;s Hand should be a highborn lord, someone
wise and learned, a battle commander or a great
knight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ser Ryam Redwyne was the greatest knight of his day, and
one of the worst Hands ever to serve a king. Septon
Murmison&rsquo;s prayers worked miracles, but as Hand he soon had
the whole realm praying for his death. Lord Butterwell was renowned
for wit, Myles Smallwood for courage, Ser Otto Hightower for
learning, yet they failed as Hands, every one. As for birth, the
dragonkings oft chose Hands from amongst their own blood, with
results as various as Baelor Breakspear and Maegor the Cruel.
Against this, you have Septon Barth, the blacksmith&rsquo;s son the
Old King plucked from the Red Keep&rsquo;s library, who gave the
realm forty years of peace and plenty.&rdquo; Pylos smiled.
&ldquo;Read your history, Lord Davos, and you will see that your
doubts are groundless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I read history, when I cannot read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any man can read, my lord,&rdquo; said Maester Pylos.
&ldquo;There is no magic needed, nor high birth, I am teaching the
art to your son, at the king&rsquo;s command. Let me teach you as
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a kindly offer, and not one that Davos could refuse. And
so every day he repaired to the maester&rsquo;s chambers high atop
Sea Dragon Tower, to frown over scrolls and parchments and great
leather tomes and try to puzzle out a few more words. His efforts
often gave him headaches, and made him feel as big a fool as
Patchface besides. His son Devan was not yet twelve, yet he was
well ahead of his father, and for Princess Shireen and Edric Storm
reading seemed as natural as breathing. When it came to books,
Davos was more a child than any of them. Yet he persisted. He was
the King&rsquo;s Hand now, and a King&rsquo;s Hand should read.</p>

<p>The narrow twisting steps of Sea Dragon Tower had been a sore
trial to Maester Cressen after he broke his hip. Davos still found
himself missing the old man. He thought Stannis must as well. Pylos
seemed clever and diligent and well-meaning, but he was so young,
and the king did not confide in him as he had in Cressen. The old
man had been with Stannis so long&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Until
he ran afoul of Melisandre, and died for it</em>.</p>

<p>At the top of the steps Davos heard a soft jingle of bells that
could only herald Patchface. The princess&rsquo;s fool was waiting
outside the maester&rsquo;s door for her like a faithful hound.
Dough-soft and slump-shouldered, his broad face tattooed in a
motley pattern of red and green squares, Patchface wore a helm made
of a rack of deer antlers strapped to a tin bucket. A dozen bells
hung from the tines and rang when he
moved&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which meant constantly, since the
fool seldom stood still. He jingled and jangled his way everywhere
he went; small wonder that Pylos had exiled him from
Shireen&rsquo;s lessons. &ldquo;Under the sea the old fish eat the
young fish,&rdquo; the fool muttered at Davos. He bobbed his head,
and his bells clanged and chimed and sang. &ldquo;I know, I know,
oh oh oh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up here the young fish teach the old fish,&rdquo; said
Davos, who never felt so ancient as when he sat down to try and
read. It might have been different if aged Maester Cressen had been
the one teaching him, but Pylos was young enough to be his son.</p>

<p>He found the maester seated at his long wooden table covered
with books and scrolls, across from the three children. Princess
Shireen sat between the two boys. Even now Davos could take great
pleasure in the sight of his own blood keeping company with a
princess and a king&rsquo;s bastard. <em>Devan will be a lord now, not
merely a knight. The Lord of the Rainwood</em>. Davos took more pride in
that than in wearing the title himself. <em>He reads too. He reads and
he writes, as if he had been born to it</em>. Pylos had naught but
praise for his diligence, and the master-at-arms said Devan was
showing promise with sword and lance as well. <em>And he is a godly
lad, too</em>. &ldquo;My brothers have ascended to the Hall of Light, to
sit beside the Lord,&rdquo; Devan had said when his father told him
how his four elder brothers had died. &ldquo;I will pray for them
at the nightfires, and for you as well, Father, so you might walk
in the Light of the Lord till the end of your days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morrow to you, Father,&rdquo; the boy greeted him.
<em>He looks so much like Dale did at his age</em>, Davos thought. His
eldest had never dressed so fine as Devan in his squire&rsquo;s
raiment, to be sure, but they shared the same square plain face,
the same forthright brown eyes, the same thin brown flyaway hair.
Devan&rsquo;s cheeks and chin were dusted with blond hair, a fuzz
that would have shamed a proper peach, though the boy was fiercely
proud of his &ldquo;beard.&rdquo; <em>Just as Dale was proud of his,
once</em>. Devan was the oldest of the three children at the table.</p>

<p>Yet Edric Storm was three inches taller and broader in the chest
and shoulders. He was his father&rsquo;s son in that; nor did he
ever miss a morning&rsquo;s work with sword and shield. Those old
enough to have known Robert and Renly as children said that the
bastard boy had more of their look than Stannis had ever shared;
the coal-black hair, the deep blue eyes, the mouth, the jaw, the
cheekbones. Only his ears reminded you that his mother had been a
Florent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, good morrow, my lord,&rdquo; Edric echoed. The boy
could be fierce and proud, but the maesters and castellans and
masters-at-arms who&rsquo;d raised him had schooled him well in
courtesy. &ldquo;Do you come from my uncle? How fares His
Grace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Davos lied. If truth be told, the king had a
haggard, haunted look about him, but he saw no need to burden the
boy with his fears. &ldquo;I hope I have not disturbed your
lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had just finished, my lord,&rdquo; Maester Pylos
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were reading about King Daeron the First.&rdquo;
Princess Shireen was a sad, sweet, gentle child, far from pretty.
Stannis had given her his square jaw and Selyse her Florent ears,
and the gods in their cruel wisdom had seen fit to compound her
homeliness by afflicting her with greyscale in the cradle. The
disease had left one cheek and half her neck grey and cracked and
hard, though it had spared both her life and her sight. &ldquo;He
went to war and conquered Dorne. The Young Dragon, they called
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He worshiped false gods,&rdquo; said Devan, &ldquo;but he
was a great king otherwise, and very brave in battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; agreed Edric Storm, &ldquo;but my father
was braver. The Young Dragon never won three battles in a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The princess looked at him wide-eyed. &ldquo;Did Uncle Robert
win three battles in a day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bastard nodded. &ldquo;It was when he&rsquo;d first come
home to call his banners. Lords Grandison, Cafferen, and Fell
planned to join their strength at Summerhall and march on
Storm&rsquo;s End, but he learned their plans from an informer and
rode at once with all his knights and squires. As the plotters came
up on Summerhall one by one, he defeated each of them in turn
before they could join up with the others. He slew Lord Fell in
single combat and captured his son Silveraxe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Devan looked to Pylos. &ldquo;Is that how it
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>said</em> so, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Edric Storm said before
the maester could reply. &ldquo;He smashed all three of them, and
fought so bravely that Lord Grandison and Lord Cafferen became his
men afterward, and Silveraxe too. No one ever beat my
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edric, you ought not boast,&rdquo; Maester Pylos said.
&ldquo;King Robert suffered defeats like any other man. Lord Tyrell
bested him at Ashford, and he lost many a tourney tilt as
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won more than he lost, though. And he killed Prince
Rhaegar on the Trident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he did,&rdquo; the maester agreed. &ldquo;But now I
must give my attention to Lord Davos, who has waited so patiently.
We will read more of King Daeron&rsquo;s <em>Conquest of Dorne</em> on the
morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Princess Shireen and the boys said their farewells courteously.
When they had taken their leaves, Maester Pylos moved closer to
Davos. &ldquo;My lord, perhaps you would like to try a bit of
<em>Conquest of Dorne</em> as well?&rdquo; He slid the slender leather-bound
book across the table. &ldquo;King Daeron wrote with an elegant
simplicity, and his history is rich with blood, battle, and
bravery. Your son is quite engrossed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son is not quite twelve. I am the King&rsquo;s Hand.
Give me another letter, if you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish, my lord.&rdquo; Maester Pylos rummaged about
his table, unrolling and then discarding various scraps of
parchment. &ldquo;There are no new letters. Perhaps an old
one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davos enjoyed a good story as well as any man, but Stannis had
not named him Hand for his enjoyment, he felt. His first duty was
to help his king rule, and for that he must needs understand the
words the ravens brought. The best way to learn a thing was to do
it, he had found; sails or scrolls, it made no matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This might serve our purpose.&rdquo; Pylos passed him a
letter.</p>

<p>Davos flattened down the little square of crinkled parchment and
squinted at the tiny crabbed letters. Reading was hard on the eyes,
that much he had learned early. Sometimes he wondered if the
Citadel offered a champion&rsquo;s purse to the maester who wrote
the smallest hand. Pylos had laughed at the notion,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;five kings,&rdquo; read
Davos, hesitating briefly over <em>five</em>, which he did not often see
written out. &ldquo;The
king&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
king&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;beware?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Beyond</em>,&rdquo; the maester corrected.</p>

<p>Davos grimaced. &ldquo;The King beyond the Wall
comes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;comes <em>south</em>. He leads
a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a <em>vast</em> host of
wil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wild&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wildlings.
Lord
M&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mmmor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mormont
sent a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;raven from
the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haunted. The <em>haunted forest</em>.&rdquo; Pylos underlined the
words with the point of his finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the haunted forest. He
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>under</em>
a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;attack?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pleased, he plowed onward.
&ldquo;Oth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other birds have come since,
with no words.
We&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mormont
slain with all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with all
his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;stench&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no,
<em>strength</em>. We fear Mormont slain with all his
strength&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Davos suddenly realized
just what he was reading. He turned the letter over, and saw that
the wax that had sealed it had been black. &ldquo;This is from the
Night&rsquo;s Watch. Maester, has King Stannis seen this
letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought it to Lord Alester when it first arrived. He
was the Hand then. I believed he discussed it with the queen. When
I asked him if he wished to send a reply, he told me not to be a
fool. &lsquo;His Grace lacks the men to fight his own battles, he
has none to waste on wildlings,&rsquo; he said to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was true enough. And this talk of five kings would
certainly have angered Stannis. &ldquo;Only a starving man begs
bread from a beggar,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something my wife said once.&rdquo; Davos drummed his
shortened fingers against the tabletop. The first time he had seen
the Wall he had been younger than Devan, serving aboard the
<em>Cobblecat</em> under Roro Uhoris, a Tyroshi known up and down the narrow
sea as the Blind Bastard, though he was neither blind nor baseborn.
Roro had sailed past Skagos into the Shivering Sea, visiting a
hundred little coves that had never seen a trading ship before. He
brought steel; swords, axes, helms, good chainmail hauberks, to
trade for furs, ivory, amber, and obsidian. When the <em>Cobblecat</em>
turned back south her holds were stuffed, but in the Bay of Seals
three black galleys came out to herd her into Eastwatch. They lost
their cargo and the Bastard lost his head, for the crime of trading
weapons to the wildlings.</p>

<p>Davos had traded at Eastwatch in his smuggling days. The black
brothers made hard enemies but good customers, for a ship with the
right cargo. But while he might have taken their coin, he had never
forgotten how the Blind Bastard&rsquo;s head had rolled across the
<em>Cobblecat</em>&rsquo;s deck. &ldquo;I met some wildlings when I was a
boy,&rdquo; he told Maester Pylos. &ldquo;They were fair thieves
but bad hagglers. One made off with our cabin girl. All in all,
they seemed men like any other men, some fair, some
foul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men are men,&rdquo; Maester Pylos agreed. &ldquo;Shall we
return to our reading, my lord Hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I am the Hand of the King, yes</em>. Stannis might be the King of
Westeros in name, but in truth he was the King of the Painted
Table. He held Dragonstone and Storm&rsquo;s End, and had an
ever-more-uneasy alliance with Salladhor Saan, but that was all.
How could the Watch have looked to him for help? <em>They may not know
how weak he is, how lost his cause</em>. &ldquo;King Stannis never saw
this letter, you are quite certain? Nor Melisandre?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Should I bring it to them? Even now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Davos said at once. &ldquo;You did your duty
when you brought it to Lord Alester.&rdquo; <em>If Melisandre knew of
this letter</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What was it she had said? <em>One
whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power, Davos
Seaworth. Soon comes the cold, and the night that never
ends</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And Stannis had seen a vision in the
flames, a ring of torches in the snow with terror all around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, are you unwell?&rdquo; asked Pylos.</p>

<p><em>I am frightened, Maester</em>, he might have said. Davos was
remembering a tale Salladhor Saan had told him, of how Azor Ahai
tempered Lightbringer by thrusting it through the heart of the wife
he loved. <em>He slew his wife to fight the dark. If Stannis is Azor
Ahai come again, does that mean Edric Storm must play the part of
Nissa Nissa?</em> &ldquo;I was thinking, Maester. My pardons.&rdquo;
<em>What harm if some wildling king conquers the north?</em> It was not as
though Stannis <em>held</em> the north. His Grace could scarcely be expected
to defend people who refused to acknowledge him as king.
&ldquo;Give me another letter,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;This
one is too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;difficult?&rdquo; suggested
Pylos.</p>

<p><em>Soon comes the cold</em>, whispered Melisandre, <em>and the night that
never ends</em>. &ldquo;Troubling,&rdquo; said Davos.
&ldquo;Too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;troubling. A different letter,
please.&rdquo;</p>
