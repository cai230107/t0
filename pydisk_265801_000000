<h2 class="chapter">5 RED MORNING</h2>

<p>&ldquo;SIGNAL FLAGS!&rdquo; One of the knot of men at the prow
of the coaster, now being worked by sweeps up the golden river in
the early morning, nodded to the flutter of colored strips from a
pole on the bank beside the first wharf of Kars.</p>

<p>He who wore a surcoat gaudily emblazoned with a fish, horns on
snout and sloping, scaled head against a crimson square, stirred,
his hand going to his belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expected?&rdquo; He made an important question of that
one word.</p>

<p>His companion smiled. &ldquo;For what we seem, yes. But
that is as it should be. It remains to be seen now whether
Yvian is ready to welcome his father-in-law per ax with
kindness or the sword. We walk into the serpent&rsquo;s open
mouth, and that can snap shut before our reinforcements
arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a low laugh from the third member of the party.
&ldquo;Any serpent closing his jaws upon us, Ingvald, is like to
get several feet of good steel rammed up through its backbone!
There is this about blank shields&mdash;they are loyal to the man
who pays them, but remove that man and they are willing to see
reason. Let us deal with Yvian and we shall speedily have Kars
thus!&rdquo; He held out a brown hand, palm up and slowly curled
fingers inward to form a fist.</p>

<p>Simon-Fulk was wary of Koris&rsquo; impetuous estimate of the
odds. He did not underrate either the seneschal&rsquo;s fighting
ability nor his leadership, but he did question this feverish drive
which kept the other at the prow of the coaster all the way up
river, staring ahead as if his will could add to their speed. Their
crew were Sulcarmen who, as merchants, had made this run before
and knew every trick of inducing speed, all of which they had
brought into action since they had entered the river&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the main force of the Estcarpian invaders were
coming down through the foothills, ready to dash for Kars when the
signal came and that signal . . . Simon-Fulk, for the dozenth time
since they had boarded the coaster, glanced at the tall basket cage
now draped in a loose cover. In it was the Falconer&rsquo;s
addition to their party. Not one of the black-and-white hawks
which served the tough mountain fighters as scouting eyes and ears
and battle comrades&mdash;trained not only to report, but also to
fly at the enemy in attack, but a bird which could not be so easily
recognized as belonging to Estcarp&rsquo;s allies.</p>

<p>Larger than those hawks which rode at Falconer saddle bows, its
plumage was blue-gray, lightening to white on the head and tail.
Five such had been discovered overseas by Falconers serving as
marines on Sulcar ships.</p>

<p>And these had been bred and trained now for three generations. Too heavy to serve as did the regular hawks, they
were used as messengers, since they had a homing instinct, and the
ability to defend themselves in the air.</p>

<p>For Simon-Fulk&rsquo;s purpose this bird was excellent. He did
not dare take one of the regular hawks into Kars, since only
Falconers used those birds. But this new breed because of its
beauty would catch the attention, and it had been trained to hunt,
so that Yvian would welcome it as a gift.</p>

<p>Ten men, a bird and a whole city against them. This was a wild
and foolish expedition on the face of it. Yet once before four of
them had invaded this same Kars and had come out with their lives
and more. Four of them! Simon&rsquo;s hand slipped back and forth
along the ornaments on Fulk&rsquo;s belt. Three of them
now&mdash;himself, Koris and somewhere, hidden in those buildings,
Loyse. But the fourth? Do not think of her now. Wonder why she had
not returned, why she had allowed him to hear secondhand from the
witch at Verlaine that her mission had failed. Where was
she&mdash;nursing that hurt? But she had accepted the cost of
marriage between them, had come to him first! Why&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have welcomers, Lord!&rdquo; Ingvald drew
Simon&rsquo;s attention to the here and now.</p>

<p>A file of men at arms, surcoated alike with the badge of
Yvian&mdash;a mailed fist holding aloft an ax&mdash;were on the
wharf. Simon&rsquo;s fingers closed on his dart gun, the edge of
his cloak discreetly veiling that movement. But on a barked order
from their officer the waiting squad clapped their bared hands
together and then raised them for an instant, palm out and shoulder
high, the greeting of a friendly salute. Thus they were welcomed to
Kars.</p>

<p>There was another turn out of barehanded, saluting troops at the
citadel gate. And, as far as they had been able to judge on their
march through the city, life in Kars flowed smoothly, no sign of
unease.</p>

<p>But when they had been ushered with the formality of court etiquette into the suite of chambers in the mid-bulk of the citadel, Simon beckoned Ingvald and Koris to a bowed
window. The seven they had brought with them from Verlaine remained
by the door. Simon indicated them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koris was frowning. &ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bottle us all up together,&rdquo; Ingvald suggested.
&ldquo;And if such handling gives us warning, they apparently do
not care. Also&mdash;where is Yvian, or at least his constable? We
were escorted by a sergeant-at-arms, no one of higher rank. We may
be in guests&rsquo; quarters, but they skimp badly on the
courtesy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more wrong than insult for Fulk in this.&rdquo;
Simon pulled off the dead man&rsquo;s ornate helm and leaned his
head against the wall where a breeze ruffled the heavy forelock of
red-gold hair which he had borne from the shape-changing. &ldquo;To
pen us together is a security move. And Yvian has no reason to
honor Fulk. But here there is more&mdash;&rdquo; He closed his
eyes, tried to make that mysterious sixth sense deliver other than
just the warning which had been growing stronger every step he
took into the enemy&rsquo;s hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sending&mdash;there is a sending?&rdquo; Koris
demanded.</p>

<p>Simon opened his eyes. Once a sending had brought him into Kars,
a dull pain in his head which marched him, hot, cold, hot, down
streets and alleyways to Jaelithe&rsquo;s lodging. No, what he
was feeling now was not the same as that. This&mdash;it drew him
forward, yes&mdash;but that was not all. He tingled with a kind of
anticipation, such as one felt on the verge of taking some
irrevocable step. But also it was not altogether concerned with
him. Rather as if he now moved on the edge of some action; brushed
by it, but not the true focus point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sending,&rdquo; he made belated answer. &ldquo;There
is something here on the move . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koris shifted the ax on which he leaned. Volt&rsquo;s gift
was never far from his hand. But for his entrance into
Kars it had been disguised with leaf foil and paint into the
ornament weapon of a lord&rsquo;s constable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ax grows alive,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;Volt&mdash;&rdquo; His voice sank to a whisper which could
not reach beyond the window bay. &ldquo;Volt guide us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in the main block,&rdquo; he added more briskly,
and Simon knew that Koris was reviewing mentally the plan of
Kars&rsquo; citadel as they had learned it from reports.
&ldquo;Yvian&rsquo;s private chambers are in the north tower. The
upper corridor should have no more than a pair of guards at its far
end.&rdquo; He moved towards the door of their own suite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Ingvald looked to Simon. &ldquo;Do we wait
or move now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had planned to wait, but this compulsion Simon could sense
. . . Perhaps the bold move was the right one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waldis!&rdquo; One of the men in Verlaine livery looked
up alertly. &ldquo;We have need for a sack of the bird&rsquo;s
grain; it was forgotten in the ship&mdash;you seek to send a
messenger for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon pulled aside the covering of the hawk&rsquo;s basket.
Those bright eyes, not golden as was usual in that breed, but dark,
regarded him intently, having in them a measure of
intelligence&mdash;not human kind&mdash;but yet intelligence. He
had never given the bird more than passing heed before, but now he
watched it closely as he put hand to the fastening of its
prison.</p>

<p>The feathered head turned, away from him, to the door of the
room, as if the white one also listened, or strove to hear what
could not be picked up by any ear. Then the curved beak opened and
the bird uttered a piercing scream at the same moment Simon caught
it too&mdash;that troubling of the very air about them.</p>

<p>Koris stared at Volt&rsquo;s gift. The shallow disguise of
foil could not hide the gleam of the ax head, not brilliant
as from sunlight on the burnished metal, but as if the
weapon had, for an instant, held fire in its substance.</p>

<p>And as suddenly that flash was gone.</p>

<p>The wide, white wings of the hawk fluttered and for the second
time the bird screamed. Simon unlatched the cage door, held out his
wrist and arm as a bridge. The weight of the bird was a burden, it
could never have been carried so, but he held steady as it emerged.
Then it fluttered over to perch on the back of a chair.</p>

<p>One of the Borderers held back the door and Waldis came in. He
was breathing in great panting gasps and his sword was in his hand,
the point of it dripping red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have gone mad!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;They are
hunting men through the halls, cutting them down&mdash;&rdquo; It
could not be Estcarp forces; they had not yet flown their signal!
Nothing to do with them&mdash;unless something had gone widely
wrong. Ingvald caught the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, drew him closer to
Simon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who hunts? Who fights?&rdquo; he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. All of them by their badges are the duke&rsquo;s men. I heard one shout to get the
duke&mdash;that he was with his new wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koris&rsquo; breath hissed. &ldquo;I think it is time to
move.&rdquo; He was already at the door. Simon looked to the bird
mantling on the chair back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the window casement,&rdquo; he ordered the nearest
Borderer. He was being rushed, but that turmoil inside him was a
sense of time running out. And if there was already trouble within
the citadel they had best make use of that. He motioned and the
hawk took off, out through the window, setting a straight course
for those waiting. Then Simon turned and ran after Koris.</p>

<p>There was a dead man lying face up at the end of
the hallway&mdash;his face gone loose and blank. And he wore
no mail, but the tunic of some official by its richness,
the small badge of Yvian&rsquo;s service on one shoulder.
Ingvald paused by the body long enough to point out a
small rod of office, broken in two as if the dead man had
used it in a futile attempt to ward off the blow which had cut
him down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steward,&rdquo; the Borderer officer commented. But Simon
had noted something else, the inset belt about the other&rsquo;s
loose over-robe. Three rosettes, each set with a small wink of red
gem in their heart. But where the fourth should have been to
complete a balanced pattern was another ornament, a twined and
twisted knot, the same as on the belt taken from Fulk, which he,
Simon, now wore. Some new trick of fashion or&mdash;?</p>

<p>But Koris was already well up the stairs leading to the next
floor, the path which would take them to Yvian&rsquo;s apartments
and Loyse&mdash;if they were lucky. This was no time to speculate
about belt ornaments.</p>

<p>They could hear uproar now, distant shouting, the clash of arms.
Clearly an all-out struggle of some kind was in progress.</p>

<p>A shout from above, demanding. Then the thud of hollow sounding
blows. Simon and Koris burst almost together from the stairwell to
see men trying to force the door at the far end of the corridor.
Two swung a bench as a battering ram, while others of their fellows
stood, weapons in hand, waiting for the splintering barrier to
give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yaaaah&mdash;&rdquo; No real war cry, but a shattering
scream of rage, out of Koris, as if all the impatience and
frustration in him was boiling free. With a feline leap he was
halfway along the hall. Two of the Karstenians heard him, turned to
face this new attack. Simon shot and both went down, one after the
other, the darts finding marks. He was never good in cut-and-thrust
melee, having come too late to the learning of sword play, and the
niceties of ax attack were not for him. But there were few among
either the Guard of Estcarp or the Borderers who could equal his
marksmanship with a dart gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yaaaaah!&rdquo; Koris overleaped the first body, fenced
the other toppling man with a shoulder. Now Volt&rsquo;s gift was
doing bloody work with those at the battering ram.</p>

<p>Taking no heed for his back, Koris brought the ax down upon the
door, and then sprawled forward as whatever bar had held it gave
way. The swirl of Borderers had overtaken the remaining
Karstenians, passed on after a moment of tight fast work, leaving
only dead and dying behind.</p>

<p>Koris was already across the room, now snatching at a hanging to
uncover a second and narrower stair. He seemed so sure of his
objective that Simon followed without question. Another hall above
and, halfway down it, a patch of yellow. Koris grabbed at that, and
the folds of a travel cloak billowed out. He tossed it from him as
he turned to face the only closed door.</p>

<p>There was no bar here. The first peck of the ax sent it crashing
open and they looked into a bed chamber where the bed stood
denuded of curtains, its coverings ripped and torn, sliding to the
floor in an ominously stained muddle. The man whose fingers were
still tightly clawed into those coverlets lay face down. But his
legs moved feebly as they watched, striving perhaps to lift him
again. Koris stalked forward and put hand to the hunched shoulder,
rolled him over.</p>

<p>Simon had never seen Yvian of Karsten, but now he did not
mistake the harsh jut of chin, the sandy brows which were a bushy
bar across the nose. The sleekness of soft living had not
altogether wiped away the forceful mercenary who had fought battles
to become my lord duke.</p>

<p>He wore only a loose over-robe which had fallen apart at
Koris&rsquo; handling so that the powerful body, seamed with old
scars, was bare, save for a wide, wet, red band at his middle His
breath came in great sobbing gulps, and with every moment of his
arching chest, that band grew wider.</p>

<p>Koris kneeled beside the duke, so that he could look into
Yvian&rsquo;s face, meet his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; It was asked with no outer heat, merely a determination to be answered. But Simon doubted if any
words could now reach Yvian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;is&mdash;she?&rdquo; Koris repeated. Under
his hand the ax moved, catching light from the window, reflecting
it into Yvian&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>It seemed to Simon that the dying man&rsquo;s attention was not
for his questioner, but rather centered on that uncanny weapon,
long since fashioned by a non-human smith. Yvian&rsquo;s lips
moved, shaped a word, and then a second audible enough&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Volt&mdash;&rdquo; He made an effort which was visible,
looking from the ax to him who held it. And there was a kind of
puzzlement in his eyes. Koris must have guessed the source of that
for he leaned the closer to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Volt&rsquo;s ax&mdash;and I am he who bears
it&mdash;Koris of Gorm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Yvian&rsquo;s only answer was a ghostly grin, a stretch of
lips which matched the slash of his death wound. He struggled to
speak a moment later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gorm, is it? Then you will know your masters. I wish them well&mdash;hell-cat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>One hand freed its hold on the covers and he struck up, his
closed fist merely touching Koris&rsquo; jaw before it fell limply
back, that last effort having carried him over the final border
into the waiting dark.</p>

<p>Save for Yvian they found these chambers bare, nor were the
other two entrances unbarred. Koris, who had led that whirlwind
search, came back wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon agreed to that, but Yvian&rsquo;s dying words were in his
mind. Why had the duke spoke of &ldquo;your masters&rdquo; and
connected that with Gorm? For Estcarp he would more rightly have
said, &ldquo;your mistresses.&rdquo; All Karsten knew that the
council of witches ruled the north. But Gorm had had grim
masters&mdash;the Kolder! Someone had started the fighting here,
and it had not been Estcarp work. Loyse was gone; Yvian given his
death wound.</p>

<p>But they had little time to search farther. A band of
the duke&rsquo;s guards came seeking their commander and
the Borderers needs must fight their way to make a stand
elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was late night and Estcarp was indeed in Kars, when Simon
slumped in a chair and chewed at a strip of meat, trying to listen
to reports, to assess what had been done here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot continue to hold Kars,&rdquo; Guttorm of the
Falconers slopped wine from a bottle into a cup, his hand shaking
with fatigue. He had led the vans which had cut their way in from
the north gate and he had been ten hours at the business of
reaching where he now sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never intended to do so,&rdquo; Simon swallowed
his mouthful to answer. &ldquo;What we came here to
do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not done!&rdquo; The full thud was Koris&rsquo; ax
punctuating his speech, haft butt against the floor. &ldquo;She is
not in the city, unless they have hidden her away so that even the
witch can not sense her, and that I do not believe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ingvald settled a slinged arm with a grimace of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I. But the witch says there is no trace. It is as if she never was&mdash;or now is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon stirred. &ldquo;And there is one way of hiding which blanks out the power&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kolder,&rdquo; Koris replied evenly. Simon thought that
he already had accepted that dour possibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kolder,&rdquo; Simon agreed. &ldquo;What have we learned
from our prisoners&mdash;that suddenly, shortly after dawn
yesterday, within the citadel some of the officers were given
messages, all purporting to come from the duke, all definitely
ordering them to quietly assemble the men under their command and
then move in on each other! Each commander was told that one of his
own fellows was the traitor. Could anything cause greater
confusion? Then, unable to reach Yvian, even when they were
beginning to realize their orders were wrong, the fighting became
more intense as the rumor spread that Yvian had been killed by this
one or that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cover, and none of our doing,&rdquo; Guttorm stated,
&ldquo;it was only Yvian&rsquo;s own force involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cover,&rdquo; Simon nodded. &ldquo;And the only act
which
might be so covered was Yvian&rsquo;s death. With his forces
sadly split, too broken to organize a hunt for any
murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not just Yvian,&rdquo; Koris broke in, &ldquo;maybe
also&mdash;Loyse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Frankly that puzzled Simon.
Unless&mdash;his tired mind moved slowly but it moved&mdash;unless
Kolder wanted her for bait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but I shall find out!&rdquo; Once more the
butt of Volt&rsquo;s gift struck the floor with emphatic force.</p>
