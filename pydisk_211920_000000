<h2 class="chapter">XXIV</h2>

<p>We come over this hill after what seemed like forever without
seeing people and there across a valley was this walled place that
covered maybe a hundred acres. The wall wasn&rsquo;t much. It was
maybe eight or ten feet high and no thicker than the kind of stone
walls cotters put around their sheepfolds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a religious retreat,&rdquo; Raven said.
&ldquo;No banners or soldiers or anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right. We&rsquo;d seen places with the same look before,
but never so big. &ldquo;Looks old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It has a feel to it, too. Peaceful. Let&rsquo;s go
look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like a place Croaker would pass up,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He has a bad case of the curiosities. Let&rsquo;s
hope he hung around long enough to let us gain some
ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went over and found out our guesses were right. Raven got his
wish. The place was a monastery called the Temple of
Traveler&rsquo;s Repose and was a kind of warehouse for knowledge.
It had been sitting there soaking it up for a couple thousand
years.</p>

<p>We found out the guys we were chasing had stayed long enough to
teach one of the monks a little Jewel Cities dialect. In fact,
they&rsquo;d only left that very morning.</p>

<p>Raven got all excited. He wanted to head right on out and the
hell with the sun was going to hit the horizon in another hour. I
wanted to hit him over the head and slow him down. That monastery
looked like a damned good place to take a day off and get human
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Case,&rdquo; he cajoled, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
be making camp by now, right? Traveling with a wagon and a coach
the best they could&rsquo;ve done is twenty-five miles. Right? We
go all night we can grab off twenty of that, easy.&rdquo; He
learned that about the wagon and coach from the priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then we die. You maybe never need a rest, but I need
a rest and the horses need a rest and this looks like the perfect
place to do it. Hell, look at the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made exasperated noises. After all this time I still
didn&rsquo;t understand that catching Croaker was the most
important thing in the world. He was so damned tired himself his
thinking was as screwy as a possum&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the only one running shy of a full load. That
priest came down with both feet solid on Raven&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Raven grinned when he said, &ldquo;He claims the omens are so
bad they aren&rsquo;t letting anybody onto the grounds.
They&rsquo;re even chasing people out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had enough of the lingo, learned from Raven, to have gotten
part of that. Also something about &ldquo;the bad storm coming down
from the north.&rdquo; I saw I wasn&rsquo;t going to win this round
neither, so I said the hell with it and added a few comments that
would have disappointed my old potato-digging mother. I went and
shared my misery with the horses. They understood me.</p>

<p>Raven worked a deal for some supplies and we headed out. I
wondered how much farther to the edge of the world. We&rsquo;d
already come farther than I&rsquo;d ever believed possible.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk much. Not because I had the sulks.
I&rsquo;d given up on them and went fatalistic a long time ago. I
think Raven was brooding about that bit I&rsquo;d caught that he
hadn&rsquo;t mentioned. A bad storm coming down from the north.</p>

<p>In the Jewel Cities lingo &ldquo;bad&ldquo; can mean a couple
three different things. Including &ldquo;evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was barely any light left when we came to a strip of
woods. &ldquo;Going to have to walk this part,&rdquo; Raven said.
&ldquo;That priest said the road through is good enough, but
it&rsquo;s going to be hard to follow in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grunted. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the woods. My mind was
on the funny-looking hills on the other side. I&rsquo;d never seen
anything like them. They were all steep-sided, smoothly rounded,
covered with a tawny dry grass and nothing else. They looked like
the humped backs of giant animals snoozing with their legs tucked
up underneath them and their heads turned around behind them, out
of sight.</p>

<p>They were very dry, those hills. The light to see them
hadn&rsquo;t never been good, but I was sure I&rsquo;d seen a few
black burn scars before it got too dark to see anything.</p>

<p>The woods were bone-dry, too. The trees were mostly some kind of
scruffy oak with small, brittle leaves that had points almost as
sharp as holly leaves. They were a sort of blue-gray color instead
of the deep green of oaks in the north.</p>

<p>A feeble excuse for a creek dribbled through the heart of the
wood. We watered ourselves and the horses and took time out for a
snack. I was too tired to waste energy talking, except to say,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I got what it takes for another fifteen
miles. Uphill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half a minute later he surprised me by saying.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know if I got what it takes, either. Only so far
you can go on willpower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hip bothering you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might ought to have it looked at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good job for Croaker, since he done it. Let&rsquo;s see
how much we got left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We managed about six more miles, the last couple up the dry
grass hills, before we sort of collapsed by silent agreement. Raven
said, &ldquo;This time we&rsquo;ll give it an hour before we hit it
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was stubborn, that bastard.</p>

<p>We hadn&rsquo;t been there five minutes before I spotted
evidence of that bad storm from the north. &ldquo;Raven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked. He didn&rsquo;t have nothing to say. He just sighed
and helped me watch the lightning.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a cloud between us and the stars.</p>
